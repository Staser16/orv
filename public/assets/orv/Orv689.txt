689 Episode 23 Fragments of God (4)<br>
A huge amount of magical power was flowing out through my right hand, and a bright light appeared above my head.<br>
Dizziness that comes with a feeling of exhaustion.<br>
I could feel the gaze of stars in the sky.<br>
The severed head of 5th grade dragon species was looking up at me in disbelief.<br>
[You have defeated the 5th grade dragon species mutant Imoogi Bracky!]<br>
…<br>
[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is astonished by your action!]<br>
[The constellation 'Goryeo’s First Sword' praises your courage.]<br>
[The constellation 'Bald General of Justice' gives a thumbs up, saying he is also a descendant of the Korean Peninsula.]<br>
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is interested in your fighting style.]<br>
[Some constellations are interested in the proposal of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]<br>
[A total of 5,000 coins were sponsored!]<br>
From afar, I could see Bang Cheolsoo and the people of Geumho Station cheering in this direction.<br>
[30 seconds left until death.]<br>
It occurred to me that dying like this wasn't that bad.<br>
[The synchronization rate with the sponsor increases.]<br>
[The possibility of a new story germinates.]<br>
—Youngest.<br>
'Yes.'<br>
—You don’t really want to die, do you?<br>
'There are now 20 seconds left.'<br>
Is there any way to survive right now?<br>
Honestly, I don't know.<br>
Should I once again feed myself to the 'Heir of the Eternal Name'?<br>
Will that method work this time too?<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' refuses to prey on you.]<br>
It doesn't work either.<br>
Then there is no way for me.<br>
Now I only trust Kim Dokja.<br>
—Let’s see. It should be somewhere around here... Uh, over there! The head!<br>
'The head?'<br>
—Falling head! Hurry!<br>
When I looked closely, I saw that items had fallen between the monster’s head that had fallen on the floor.<br>
One was the 'core of a 5th grade monster dragon species', and the other was...<br>
"This…"<br>
I was startled and picked up the item that had fallen on the floor.<br>
To be precise, it wasn't an 'item'. It is a fragment that looks like a crude collection of very small letters.<br>
[Fragment of the story 'For a reader, a reader’s life' has been acquired.]<br>
Why on earth does the dragon have this?<br>
—Phew, it was there as expected.<br>
No, why is this—<br>
—Just feed it quickly. If you're being foolish, you'll really be in trouble.<br>
'Do you want me to feed it this?'<br>
—That’s also 'Kim Dokja’s fragment'.<br>
Just by looking at the name, it was clear that it was a fragment of Kim Dokja.<br>
[5 seconds left until death.]<br>
I really don't have time anymore.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is interested in the story fragment you have acquired!]<br>
'Want some?'<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' opens its mouth greedily.]<br>
Immediately, a sound like biting into a piece of soft meat was heard, and smoke rose from the palm of my hand.<br>
[The time limit has elapsed.]<br>
Was it successful?<br>
Can I keep living?<br>
A series of sentences flowed through my mind as if answering my questions.<br>
「"It's okay, Yoo Sangah."<br>
"Yes?"<br>
"Even if you tell me about the app, it won’t help."<br>
The genre of my life now is clearly 'realism'.<br>
"Because readers have their own lives."<br>
And in this genre, I am not the protagonist but the 'reader'.」<br>
This scene seems to be a fragment of the story, 'For a reader, a reader’s life'.<br>
Eventually, the sound of the tale burping lightly after finishing its feast was heard.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' succeeded in predation.]<br>
[The status of the story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' has slightly increased.]<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is somewhat satisfied.]<br>
[1 day time limit has been added.]<br>
1 day!<br>
My life expectancy increased by a whopping day.<br>
—Look at that. I said you wouldn't die here, right?<br>
I was dumbfounded and looked up into the air.<br>
How did Kim Dokja know that this dragon species had 'Kim Dokja’s fragment'?<br>
"Is it possible that this dragon species also appears in Ways of Survival?"<br>
—It does come out, but not like this. No matter what events exist within 'Ways of Survival', this monster cannot be here.<br>
The monster in front of me is a 'dragon species that should not be here right now'.<br>
—However, in this '41st round', an incident occurred that did not appear in any episode of 'Ways of Survival'.<br>
I immediately understood what Kim Dokja said.<br>
In this world, there was only one incident that had nothing to do with 'Ways of Survival'.<br>
Me and the existence of other readers who have read 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'.<br>
I looked down at the dead monster's head and muttered.<br>
"No way…"<br>
Perhaps this monster has eaten and erased 'readers' that I do not know.<br>
If it has evolved beyond its original level through the fragments obtained in that way.<br>
If that's the case, how many fragments of readers exist in this world? And in the process, how many readers...<br>
—Now, let’s not think about it too complicated. It could just be a fragment that fell on the road and was picked up by chance.<br>
'There's no way something like this is just lying on the street.'<br>
—Well, it's a shame.<br>
From a distance, the 4th grade monster could be seen fighting to the death with Jung Heewon.<br>
—That guy over there has a 'large fragment'.<br>
'Really?'<br>
—I’m sure. I can feel it now.<br>
A larger fragment.<br>
In other words, if I deal with that guy, I can live longer.<br>
[4th grade Earth Dragon species 'Earth Python' activates 'Annihilation Footprints'!]<br>
The entire area shook violently, and a huge seismic wave was generated centered around the guy's feet. Bright red lava overflowed through the cracks in the cracked ground.<br>
As I soared into the air using [Leap], the bloody battle between Jung Heewon and the 4th grade Earth Dragon species was visible at a glance through the clouds of dust and steam.<br>
Jung Heewon injured her thigh and shoulder.<br>
However, the Earth Dragon species also had both wings cut off and one ankle was seriously injured, so it seemed difficult to move.<br>
Strong magical power trembled from Jung Heewon's blade as if trying to determine a match.<br>
Ether Blade.<br>
The blade of pure magical power created through persistent training stretched out, and in an instant, Jung Heewon's divine form disappeared.<br>
[Incarnation 'Jung Heewon' activates 'Kendo Lv.10'!]<br>
Jung Heewon, who appeared from the sky, drew a horizontal trajectory toward the monster's neck.<br>
Even it is 4th grade, it is an unavoidable blow with injuries like that.<br>
It was the unstoppable victory of Jung Heewon.<br>
However.<br>
—Of course, it’s not an ordinary 4th grade monster.<br>
With a sound like a swoosh, the new form of the 4th grade Earth Dragon species dispersed like smoke.<br>
Jung Heewon made an embarrassed expression.<br>
Before I could warn her, the Earth Dragon species that took over Jung Heewon's rear struck her with its huge tail.<br>
Bang—<br>
With a sound, Jeong Heewon plummeted to the ground.<br>
The clever Earth Dragon left his last move until the last moment.<br>
"Heewon-ssi!"<br>
I repeatedly [jumped] with all my might and held Jung Heewon as she fell to the ground. Dark red blood leaked out from Jung Heewon's mouth.<br>
"Heewon-ssi! Come to your senses!"<br>
She still seems to have not lost her fighting spirit as the aura of [Judgement Time] and [] flowed out of her body.<br>
But I could tell just by feeling her pulse.<br>
Jung Heewon was no longer in a state to fight.<br>
I looked back at the rear battle line, which had been sorted out to some extent.<br>
Fortunately, there is no penalty for running away in this scenario.<br>
She needs to run away now.<br>
When it is difficult for the 4th grade Earth Dragon species to move, we should run away as soon as possible—<br>
—No. Catch that guy.<br>
Those were Kim Dokja’s words.<br>
—You don't know when you'll find fragments again. The only chance is now.<br>
I know. That now is an opportunity.<br>
But can I do it?<br>
Will I be able to kill that guy who even Jung Heewon couldn't defeat?<br>
—There is a chance of victory. [Staging] is not finished yet.<br>
As the hazy dust cleared, the brilliant eyes of the 4th grade Earth Dragon species were revealed.<br>
Kim Dokja was right.<br>
A faint fear reflected in its eyes.<br>
It’s afraid of me now.<br>
[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is watching your courage.]<br>
—Fight to the death, youngest. If you want to become the real 'Kim Dokja' you want to be.<br>
At that moment, I saw Bang Cheolsoo and Dayoung's mother running from behind.<br>
"Hyung! Heewon-ssi!"<br>
Instead of Bang Cheolsoo, who was carrying Shin Yoosoung, I looked at Dayoung’s mother.<br>
"Please take care of Heewon-ssi."<br>
Dayoung’s mother didn’t hesitate and carried Jung Heewon.<br>
Jung Heewon, who seemed to be still conscious, opened her eyes wide.<br>
I smiled lightly at Jung Heewon and then spoke to my companions.<br>
"From now on, do your best to leave Gwanghwamun."<br>
"Hyung! You too should leave with us—"<br>
"Bang Cheolsoo. I can save myself somehow. Protect the people who trust you first."<br>
Bang Cheolsoo, his eyes red, eventually lowered his head. He also knows that there is no way.<br>
"Withdraw! Everyone withdraw!"<br>
After Bang Cheolsoo and Dayoung's mother ran away, I looked back at the Earth Dragon.<br>
He too was looking this way, growling as if he was ready for a decisive battle.<br>
[The time limit for 'Staging' is approaching.]<br>
[The power of 'staging' weakens.]<br>
It is difficult.<br>
We can't end the stage already.<br>
"I am-"<br>
As I was preparing for [Incite] once again, I heard Kim Dokja's words.<br>
—Reproducing the same scene continuously is not effective.<br>
I know?<br>
I know. The stage once recreated through 「Staging」 does not have the same level of impact on the constellations.<br>
[A very small number of constellations ask if you are telling the same story again.]<br>
In other words, this time, like before, it was impossible to confront him just by borrowing the power of 'Kim Dokja who hunted Yamata no Orochi'.<br>
'I know.'<br>
But it didn't matter.<br>
Because-<br>
"Because the person I wanted to recreate this time was not 'Kim Dokja'."<br>
Even if the story has the same content, the main character of the story is different.<br>
If it's another person, it's a different story.<br>
The person I will recreate now is—<br>
"I am."<br>
In some ways, that protagonist surpasses even 'Kim Dokja'.<br>
"I am 'Yoo Jonghyuk' who defeated the 'Eight-Headed Monarch' in 'Peaceland'."<br>
As the pages turned in my head, the image of Yoo Jonghyuk and Yamata no Orochi fighting came to mind clearly.<br>
[Fragment of the story 'Crazy Soldier Yoo Jonghyuk' squirms.]<br>
Accordingly, the unidentified story of Yoo Jonghyuk, who I do not know when I acquired it, began to move within me.<br>
[The story 'The One Who Hunted the King of Disasters' responds to the story fragment 'Crazy Soldier Yoo Jonghyuk'.]<br>
I thought I could do it.<br>
It’s Yoo Jonghyuk in the moment when he was dealing with Yamata no Orochi.<br>
Gooooooo!<br>
The aura of Yoo Jonghyuk’s mentor, imbued with the power of stories, was carried on the clear, burning trail of Unbreakable Faith.<br>
The Earth Dragon, startled by the subversive force, hesitated and retreated.<br>
This guy.<br>
I leapt in the air, slashing my sword again and again as if struggling. The magic wave that imitated Yoo Jonghyuk's [] grew around 'Unbreakable Faith'.<br>
It wasn't easy. Even if I tried my best, reaching Yoo Jonghyuk felt like a long way off.<br>
—I!<br>
'I am.'<br>
But at least I wasn't the only one shouting these words now.<br>
—I am Yoo Jonghyuk!<br>
'I am Yoo Jonghyuk.'<br>
[The synchronization rate with the constellation is increasing!]<br>
[The reproduction rate of the story increases slightly!]<br>
The yellow pupils of the Earth Dragon species became vertically elongated.<br>
The guy was truly shocked. He was so overwhelmed by the story that he began to believe the scenery before his eyes rather than the actual damage he would receive.<br>
Eventually, when the guy's fear reached its peak. The frightened monster's new form scattered in the air.<br>
The technique used on Jung Heewon.<br>
[Fog] ability.<br>
—You got caught, you bastard.<br>
[The special option of 'Unbreakable Faith' is activated.]<br>
The fog's weakness is 'elemental attacks'.<br>
[Ether attribute is converted to 'Flame'.]<br>
I used [Nagak Breathing] to hold my breath and spin like a top, swinging the blade of flame. The particles that came into contact with the flames suffered a crushing blow and began to melt.<br>
Wow!<br>
The Earth Dragon species regaining its form crashed to the ground with its half-burnt body.<br>
At the same time, I was like, wow. And I vomited out the things inside me.<br>
Following the overlapping [Incite], it was the price of enduring the story of my sponsor for too long.<br>
[「Staging」 ends.]<br>
The stage ends and the actor leaves.<br>
[The story 'The One Who Hunted the King of Disasters' ends its storytelling.]<br>
I barely raised my head with my hands on the floor. The Earth Dragon species that had collapsed was seen standing up again.<br>
That's it.<br>
The [Fog] ability could no longer be used, but it was still alive and well.<br>
I felt like the atmosphere around me was opening up. He is preparing his final [Breath].<br>
[Fragment of the story 'Crazy Soldier Yoo Jonghyuk' looks at you pitifully.]<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk’s contempt woke me up.<br>
I didn't fall. I can never die here.<br>
I must protect people.<br>
Jung Heewon, Jung Eunho, Sergeant Kim, and the people who saved me. I must buy time for them to escape.<br>
[The synchronization rate with the sponsor is increasing!]<br>
At that moment.<br>
—Good job, youngest.<br>
A warm feeling began to circulate deep within my heart.<br>
[The coordination rate with the sponsor has reached a certain level.]<br>
[A new 'stigma' has been acquired.]<br>
The power of my constellation spread throughout my body.<br>
[The stigma 'Sacrificial Will Lv.1' is activated!]<br>
Finally, Kim Dokja's first stigma bloomed.

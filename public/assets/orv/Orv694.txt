How is the <Asgard> in the 41st round related to the 'Demon King of Salvation'?<br>
Do they know?<br>
Did they find out the information through readers?<br>
There was little chance of that happening, as most of what the readers say from 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' has probably been filtered.<br>
Or the giant nebula that killed Kim Dokja some time ago.<br>
There is a possibility that it was <Asgard>.<br>
However, even if Odin, the 'One-Eyed Father', is the strongest in <Asgard>, would it be possible to kill Kim Dokja?<br>
Shit. You must have seen a mythical constellation.<br>
To be honest, I don't understand either hypothesis right now.<br>
In the first place, I was convinced that the 'demon king' they were talking about was Kim Dokja.<br>
I held my breath and focused on the conversation between the two people.<br>
"Christina, so that’s why you were so polite to Cheon Inho-ssi—."<br>
"That's right."<br>
Christina, reflected in the rear-view mirror, twitched her lips as if disapproving.<br>
"He smells like a demon king. I didn’t feel it at all at first, but after he fainted and woke up, I definitely sensed it."<br>
"So, does this mean that incarnation Cheon Inho is a member of the Demon King’s family?"<br>
"Probably. Not long ago, when the Demon King’s symbol appeared in Las Vegas, I faced one. The same goosebumps I felt back then were conveyed to me."<br>
By nature, hypnotists and other psychics have a much better sense of energy than other incarnations.<br>
It wouldn't be strange to say that Christina Page, who considered herself to be the best among them, could read the demon king's unique energy.<br>
Anyway, Kim Dokja is also half a demon king.<br>
"If it is a demon king, which of the 72 demon kings would it be?"<br>
"I don’t know that."<br>
"Have you had any other contact from <Asgard>?"<br>
"Not at all. After that question, the messages stopped."<br>
The two people glanced in my direction and from then on continued their conversation without speaking.<br>
[Group chat].<br>
It looks like there's a story that no one should hear.<br>
In the silence that follows, all that is visible outside is a barren desert landscape. I spent my time thinking about future scenarios in my head or observing my sleeping face while snoring.<br>
As I keep looking at this face, it now seems like my real face.<br>
But does I look like a fraudster like that?<br>
But Yoosoung told me I was handsome...<br>
Would it be a good idea to buy a skill like [Humidity Preservation] like Kim Dokja, or to change the atmosphere a bit by obtaining story fragments such as [Casanova's Face]?<br>
Come to think of it, it seems like Kim Dokja is also secretly very thorough in self-management.<br>
You can tell he was concerned about turtle neck just by looking at the fact that he put a pillow on his neck for a short period of time.<br>
...Neck pillow?<br>
I felt a strange feeling for a moment, so I looked up the item.<br>
+<br>
<Item information><br>
Name: SSS grade neck pillow<br>
Grade: SSS<br>
Description: This is a 'neck pillow' made by the mass-produced manufacturer. It is characterized by a cute dokkaebi face drawing.<br>
Users of this pillow do not have any dreams and can enjoy a recovery effect comparable to consuming the essence of Elaine Forest at bedtime.<br>
When a dangerous situation occurs, the [Alarm] function is activated to force the user to wake up.<br>
*This item belongs to incarnation Cheon Inho.<br>
+<br>
It was obvious with whose coin this person bought the pillow.<br>
Even though it was just a pillow, I looked up the price thinking how much it would cost and my eyes almost popped out.<br>
[The price of this item is 10,000 coins.]<br>
After thoroughly checking the refund policy and return procedures for the dokkaebi bag, I decided to charge Kim Dokja the amount.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated.]<br>
—Phew, I slept well.<br>
What amazing timing.<br>
I fired off questions in quickly.<br>
'When did you buy this pillow?'<br>
—Just before I went to sleep.<br>
'Try to convince me. Before I get really angry.'<br>
Kim Dokja, who had already finished understanding the situation, rolled his eyes.<br>
He started talking.<br>
—Humans spend one-third of their day sleeping.<br>
'Now we don’t have to sleep that much.'<br>
—This is an item that Yoo Jonghyuk and Yoo Sangah also used.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk used this item?<br>
This item with a cute dokkaebi face drawn on it?<br>
—That kid is so popular that someone must have given it to him as a gift. Anyway, it's a useful item for us. We faint a lot.<br>
'So?'<br>
—Be sure to support your neck before you fall. If you get a concussion, it's a big deal.<br>
'…'<br>
—And read the options carefully. It is said that it has a similar effect to consuming the essence of Elaine Forest when sleeping.<br>
I calculated it in my head.<br>
'Elain Forest's Spirit' costs 500 coins each.<br>
That means.<br>
—Even if you use it just 20 times, you get your money's worth.<br>
'How many times can I use it?'<br>
—Well. If you use it sparingly, wouldn’t it be able to be used for quite a long time? It says here that after-sales service is also provided.<br>
'I admit. I forgive you for your sins.'<br>
This was a very efficient item, right?<br>
I feel good knowing that I once again made a satisfactory purchase.<br>
After sleeping well, Kim Dokja stretched lightly and looked out the window.<br>
I turned around.<br>
Slowly, the city of Las Vegas was appearing.<br>
[The seventh 'main scenario' is currently in progress.]<br>
[The eighth 'main scenario' is currently in progress.]<br>
A series of system messages appeared.<br>
I was puzzled.<br>
The seventh scenario hasn't even been completed, but the  scenario is in progress?<br>
—There was something like this in the 3rd round too.<br>
I remember too. While the fourth scenario was in progress, part of the fifth scenario, the 'Disaster' scenario, was solved.<br>
However, it was a temporary situation at that time, and the two main scenarios did not unfold simultaneously like they do now.<br>
Something seems wrong.<br>
Kim Dokja also nodded in agreement.<br>
'The seventh would be a monster invasion scenario, what would the eighth be?'<br>
For reference, Korea's eighth scenario in the third round was 'The Strongest Scapegoat'.<br>
—That was the third round in Korea. I don't know what it's like here.<br>
'That's right.'<br>
The 'Strongest Sacrifice' scenario is an extreme scenario that ends only when half of the incarnations in the area die or when the strongest incarnation dies.<br>
I hope it will be a smooth scenario in the 41st round.<br>
"We’ve arrived. You’re already up."<br>
"Thanks to you, I slept well."<br>
Selena Kim laughed at Kim Dokja's sly answer.<br>
The entrance to the casino hotel, the symbol of Las Vegas, began to be visible in the distance.<br>
I guess it's because it's still daytime. The hotel street, with the lights off, had a somewhat eerie atmosphere for a gambling mecca.<br>
[The constellation 'Bald General of ' wipes his head with a curious expression.]<br>
[The constellation 'Maritime War God' shakes his head saying that these buildings are not clean.]<br>
[The constellation 'King Heungmu' boasts that they cannot imitate the architectural style of the Korean Peninsula.]<br>
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' holds his tongue as he looks at the constellations on the Korean Peninsula.]<br>
Well, the whole world has already become a gambling den for constellations, so how meaningful is it to see a human gambling den?<br>
Christina parked her car in front of the largest hotel on Casino Street.<br>
This is the home of Zarathustra.<br>
When the doorman who came to greet us opened the car door, a crowd of people gathered at the entrance of the casino hotel was noticed. A mixed group of people of various races, each with their own weapons.<br>
Kim Dokja asked with a grin.<br>
"Am I not a welcome guest?"<br>
"It’s not our group."<br>
Selena Kim and Christina stood in front of Kim Dokja as if guarding him.<br>
When I  it, I was a bit puzzled because the local situation on the American side was never revealed in the main story.<br>
But Kim Dokja already knew who they were.<br>
—It looks like the Las Vegas civil war is not over yet.<br>
'Do you know who it is?'<br>
—Las Vegas gang.<br>
Is it like the American ironclad faction?<br>
—It's a much more elite organization than those guys.<br>
'But there is an absolute throne in America too, right? The unification of forces would have been achieved.'<br>
—Have you already forgotten what we did?<br>
It occurred to me later that Kim Dokja killed the founder of the absolute throne.<br>
What if America’s 'absolute throne' also lost its effectiveness like the one in Korea did?<br>
Now that the throne's absolute power has disappeared, it is naturally useless.<br>
—Anna must be having a headache too.<br>
Naturally, it is powerful force that fills the place where the throne has disappeared.<br>
A powerful force that can claim to be the king.<br>
Before we knew it, the leader of the group approached us.<br>
A long fur coat and a T-shirt with a skull on it. A cross necklace shining in silver. A Hispanic man wearing a cowboy hat that looked like something out of a western movie. Even at a glance, he was giving off an unusual vibe.<br>
"Who are you?"<br>
When Kim Dokja asked, Selena Kim answered.<br>
"Jacob Martinez. King of North Las Vegas."<br>
When the man got close enough, Selena Kim took a step forward and said,<br>
"Mr. Martinez."<br>
The man responded, nodding his head towards Selena Kim.<br>
"It’s been a while. Guardian of the King."<br>
"What’s going on here?"<br>
"I came to see the prophet."<br>
It looks like Anna Croft has some business to do over there, just like us. Judging by the ghastly atmosphere, it didn't seem like the visit was for good reasons.<br>
Christina, who was watching the situation, intervened.<br>
"I’m sorry, but Anna has plans today. Why don’t you come next time?"<br>
"Get out of the way."<br>
"If it’s urgent, tell me what you want. I’ll tell her."<br>
Martinez glared at Cristina with a cold gaze.<br>
"We have come to demand compensation."<br>
"Compensation? What compensation?"<br>
"Our group suffered too much damage during the subjugation of the 4 grade monster species. We demand compensation for that."<br>
4th grade 4. It seems that a similar level of monster species has appeared in the United States as well.<br>
"The damage was all the same."<br>
"We lost our entire home. It’s because your masterful touts guided the direction of the 'disaster' to the northern part of Las Vegas."<br>
"It’s not Anna’s fault. Even Anna can’t do anything about a natural disaster."<br>
"Are you saying the prophet couldn’t read the future?"<br>
"Hey."<br>
"She must have seen the northern part of Las Vegas flying away with her vision of the future. Yet the prophet did not give us any indication."<br>
"…"<br>
"If the response had been a little late, all the women and children would have been swept away to death."<br>
Before I knew it, Kim Dokja and I were listening attentively to the two people's argument.<br>
Anna must have had her own reasons for not telling them everything about the future.<br>
But if someone else dies in return, whose responsibility is it?<br>
How much responsibility does a prophet who knows the future bear for not telling the future she knows?<br>
Christina answered with a frown.<br>
"I'll discuss compensation and coin support. So, leave at this point. Unless you want to make a big deal out of it."<br>
"I guess I need to meet the Prophet."<br>
With a clanking sound, Martinez pulled out his pistol from its holster. At the same time, the group guarding him also pointed their weapons in this direction.<br>
If this continues, a large-scale armed conflict is expected.<br>
But Christina didn't look nervous. There was already a pocket watch in her right hand.<br>
Martinez said.<br>
"I already know about your hypnotism skills."<br>
"..."<br>
"Would it be faster for your watch to tick? Or would it be faster for my bullet to blow a hole in your head?"<br>
"You can try it now—"<br>
Everything happened in an instant.<br>
Was it first that I heard the sound of a fur coat flapping, or that the person who had been the doorman a moment ago transformed into Martinez?<br>
Front and left. The two Martinezes opened their mouths at the same time.<br>
"You seem to have forgotten who I am, hypnotist."<br>
Before we knew it, Martinez's pistol was touching Christina's left eyebrow. Biting her lip, Christina slowly dropped her watch, holding both of her hands above her head.<br>
I asked, somewhat impressed by Martinez's skills.<br>
'How did he do it? Avatar?'<br>
[Avatar] is the author’s unique skill.<br>
So, is Martinez also a 'writer'?<br>
—That guy is a 'magician'.<br>
Magician?<br>
"Hypnotist, I am going to kill you from now on."<br>
"Martinez, wait a minute."<br>
"If anyone moves, I will shoot immediately."<br>
Martinez, who glared at Selena Kim, added as if warning.<br>
"I’ll count to three. If your leader is really a 'prophet', she will come out on her own. She would have read the future where her subordinates will die."<br>
Martinez immediately started counting to three. A cold count without any hesitation.<br>
However, even when the count reached 1, Anna Croft did not appear.<br>
"It seems the prophet’s name was fake. Otherwise—"<br>
The trigger was pulled.<br>
"She didn’t value you at all."<br>
And there was someone who moved a little faster than the trigger.<br>
"Anna won’t come out."<br>
As expected, everything happened in a split second.<br>
No, it was probably a long and leisurely time, even though it only lasted a moment.<br>
Kim Dokja slowly raised his arm and gently wrapped the end of the pistol as if holding a teacup.<br>
"She can’t see the future right now."<br>
Nevertheless, no one except me could witness his actions.<br>
Christina, Selena Kim, and Martinez all looked shocked.<br>
A face of disbelief as to how on earth this was possible.<br>
[The constellation 'Humanity’s First Magician' is astonished.]<br>
Only I knew the method used by Kim Dokja.<br>
It was neither skills nor magic.<br>
[The story 'The Stone and I' ends.]<br>
Martinez came to his senses late and urgently pulled the trigger.<br>
Click. Click.<br>
But the pistol did not fire.<br>
[The story of 'The Pistol and I' continues.]<br>
Kim Dokja snatched the pistol at once and pulled the trigger into the air as if he was joking.<br>
"Because I came."<br>
With a bang, a congratulatory shot rang out announcing our debut in Las Vegas.

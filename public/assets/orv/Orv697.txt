697 Episode 24 Expert (7)<br>
An hour after Cheon Inho fainted, Yoo Jonghyuk went to Las Vegas.<br>
The group that came with him was as follows.<br>
Steel Emperor Lee Hyunsung.<br>
Maritime Admiral Lee Jihye.<br>
Delusional Demon Kim Namwoon.<br>
Doctor Lee Seolhwa.<br>
Beast Tamer Shin Yoosung.<br>
The five incarnations who have been by his side for the past dozens of rounds.<br>
If you look closely, they were all people with at least one flaw.<br>
Lee Hyunsung was too foolish, and Lee Jihye was too simple. Kim Namwoon was a crazy person, and Lee Seolhwa was often bitter. Shin Yoosung was weak-hearted.<br>
He repeatedly changed the main members or formed new parties several times.<br>
But in the end, these are the five that remain. They were the only ones who stayed by Yoo Jonghyuk's side until the very end.<br>
"Ugh, this is my first time in America. Has Seolhwa ever been here?"<br>
Lee Seolhwa answered Lee Jihye’s question with a faint smile.<br>
"When I was young."<br>
"Tsk. I know a lot about America. Jihye, are you curous?"<br>
"No."<br>
"I’m nervous because the only time I ever deployed troops was to Iraq."<br>
"Hyunsung, you’re always nervous."<br>
Compared to the previous round, the mood among the group was brighter.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk found Shin  remaining silent alone in the midst of a lively conversation. Although she originally had a dark personality, the shadow that now fell on Shin Yoosoung's face was not just due to her personality.<br>
As Yoo Jonghyuk was about to approach Shin Yoosung, a voice was heard from behind.<br>
"That’s amazing. Is that the status of the 'Five Heavenly Emperors' who protect the Supreme King?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk frowned and thought. Looking back, there was another 'party that came with him'. He just didn't consider them his companions.<br>
"Five Heavenly Emperors? Was there a nickname like that?"<br>
"I attached it."<br>
"Do not pollute the Book of Revelation."<br>
A beautiful woman sighed lightly behind two bickering young men.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk knew who they were.<br>
Kang Ilhoon, although his tone is harsh, is believed to be the incarnation of an archangel.<br>
, the de facto leader of the Chungmuro Group and the teammate of Armed Castle Lord Gong Pildu.<br>
Le Seyeon who possesses strong interpersonal fighting skills and is armed with S-class or higher items.<br>
They were the incarnations who quickly emerged as new powerhouses in this round.<br>
Although he never told anyone, Yoo Jonghyuk knew one thing the three had in common.<br>
'They are past evildoers.'<br>
Their names remained in his memories of the last round that came to mind.<br>
Small villains who were major thieves, betrayed their party, or became looters.<br>
These little villains were proudly leading the incarnations to the forefront of the main scenario this time.<br>
To be exact, it wasn't just them.<br>
"Dansu ahjussi, why are you sighing like that?"<br>
Another man and woman followed behind them.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk even knew their names.<br>
"As expected, I’m worried about Inho-ssi. I should have stayed too."<br>
Although not as strong as Lee Hunsung, Kyung Sein is the second-strongest tanker after Lee Hyunsung.<br>
Although his fighting skills are not outstanding, Lee Dans reminds him of 'Selena Kim', who was the Immortal King in the previous round.<br>
If he remembers well, he also had a minor dispute with these incarnations in a certain round.<br>
'Is it a coincidence? Or not…'<br>
Even if it was a coincidence, there was nothing particularly strange about it.<br>
In the countless rounds of his life, every human being, including Yoo Jonghyuk himself, became a villain at least once.<br>
What Yoo Jonghyuk learned through this was that humans are just empty vessels.<br>
All humans become completely different beings depending on what kind of 'tale' they face and what kind of story they live.<br>
He knows it's true.<br>
However, it was not easy to admit the truth that just one man instigated it.<br>
'Cheon Inho.'<br>
So far, without a single exception, 'Cheon Inho' has been a villain in all rounds. Whether small or large, he became a villain and blocked Yoo Jonghyuk's path.<br>
As if that was his absolute mission.<br>
However, 'Cheon Inho' in this round has not yet become a villain.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk found that fact very strange.<br>
"What are you thinking about?"<br>
Yoo Mia, who was walking next to him, squeezed his left hand. Yoo Jonghyuk spoke without shaking her hand.<br>
"It is nothing."<br>
"You thought of the man with narrow eyes."<br>
"He is dangerous."<br>
"He looks like that old swindler."<br>
"Right."<br>
"But if you listen to what people say, he seems to be a good swindler."<br>
'Good swindler.'<br>
While Yoo Jonghyuk was surprised that young Yoo Mia knew such an expression, he wondered whether he should correct the contradiction in the expression.<br>
But he couldn't think of anything to retort.<br>
Instead, Yoo Jonghyuk decided to recall the memories of the last round.<br>
What a bad guy he was in the last round and how dangerous it is to trust him...<br>
['The Redemption of Truth' controls your memory.]<br>
Redemption of Truth.<br>
One of the three stories he engraved.<br>
This imprint seals some of the memories in exchange for great power.<br>
Although he was a little concerned that this memory had been sealed, Yoo Jonghyuk didn't really care.<br>
In any case, the 'memory' that would be the key to clearing this round was remembered by someone other than him.<br>
"It’s been a long time, King Yoo Jonghyuk."<br>
Across from the casino hotel stood the person whose memories he wanted.<br>
Zarathustra's representative and his old enemy.<br>
"Anna Croft."<br>
*<br>
While heading to the Washington Dome, Yoo Jonghyuk tried to avoid eye contact with Anna Croft as much as possible.<br>
['Emotional restraint' stirs.]<br>
This is because it was difficult to handle the growing excitement in real time.<br>
He wanted to bring Cheon Inho to prepare for this kind of situation.<br>
But it might be too late to turn back now.<br>
"Prophet. There is a memory I need. Use [past tense]."<br>
"I exhausted all my reps today."<br>
[You are using 'Lie Detection'.]<br>
['Lie Detection' confirmed that the statement was true.]<br>
Anna Croft's expression hardened at the message about using the skill.<br>
"Lie Detection, do you not have the minimum level of trust?"<br>
"I’d rather trust a good swindler than trust you."<br>
"Who is the good swindler?"<br>
"Don’t pry into unnecessary things."<br>
"You brought it up first—"<br>
"I’ll tell you in advance, I don’t have much patience in this round."<br>
Instead of answering, Anna Croft glared at him with disapproving eyes.<br>
At that moment, Y Jonghyuk felt the urge to pull out his spear and hit her on the head.<br>
This was because dozens of past tragedies caused by Anna Croft came to mind all at once.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Redemption Lv.5' is being activated.]<br>
[The influence of 'Redemption' is temporarily weakened by the effect of 'Three Persons'.]<br>
But he had to endure it.<br>
At least she'll be useful until all the constellations in this world run out.<br>
However, the moment Yoo Jonghyuk checked the local situation, he began to doubt Anna Croft's 'usefulness'.<br>
"Why did the scenario end up like this?"<br>
In only the fifth scenario, the entire Washington Dome was eroded.<br>
The surviving incarnations make up about 5% of the entire population of the dome.<br>
This was something that had never happened in any round before.<br>
"An unexpected situation occurred."<br>
"There’s always something like that."<br>
"I had a plan."<br>
"A plan that cannot be kept is useless. If you cannot come up with a convincing answer, you will die here."<br>
Anna Croft let out a deep sigh at his threat. It was a strangely despondent sigh that he had never seen before in any round.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk. Have you ever heard of a group called 'Apostles'?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk nodded his head.<br>
"As expected... it looks like they were in Korea too."<br>
Judging by the way she spoke, it seemed that Washington's downfall had something to do with the 'Apostles'.<br>
"Could it be that Korea also failed to kill the disasters?"<br>
"I am in Korea."<br>
"Of course it is. I was just asking just in case."<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk ended the fifth scenario in Korea.<br>
A disaster that was different from his memories appeared and the method of dealing with it was a little different from the previous round, but the scenario itself went smoothly anyway.<br>
"It hasn’t been smooth sailing for us."<br>
"I guess I know roughly what the situation is."<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk also heard something about the 'Apostles'.<br>
Beings who know the 'future' of the world.<br>
"That’s what happens because you rely too much on things like [future sight]. You probably know that there is no such thing as a fixed future."<br>
"The future was written. Until they showed up."<br>
Anna Croft has been clearing the scenarios by reading the future and preparing for it.<br>
However, in this round, the variable 'Apostles' intervened and all her plans went awry.<br>
"If you help me with this matter, I will definitely repay your debt, King."<br>
"I hope you can continue to be useful until the debt is paid."<br>
The moment they entered the portal, the surrounding scenery changed into waves.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk had his companions wait for a while and then went up to a nearby high-rise building to check the view.<br>
This was not his first time visiting the Washington Dome.<br>
But it was his first time seeing a scene like this.<br>
It seemed as if the entire city was buried in pitch-black ashes.<br>
There was no sight of living incarnations anywhere.<br>
All the high-rise buildings that made up the skyscrapers were in ruins, and the sky was covered with fog that obscured even the light of the stars.<br>
On the roof of the building, black roots reminiscent of a tree growing upside down were sprouting.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk tore off the root without hesitation.<br>
Then, a roaring black ether poured out between the torn roots.<br>
A 'dark root' that vomits demonic energy.<br>
It was definitely true.<br>
'The Demon Realm.'<br>
He doesn't know what number this demon realm was, but the 'Washington Dome' was invaded by a demon realm.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, who landed lightly on the ground, asked Anna.<br>
"Have you secured the parts of the Earth Dragon species?"<br>
"I’m trying."<br>
In order to fight in an invaded demon world, [Purification] work is essential. Otherwise, you will be cursed.<br>
[Currently, the 'Washington Dome' has been eroded by the demon realm.]<br>
['Local curse' is activated!]<br>
[Spiritual power decreases slightly in the area!]<br>
[Comprehensive stats are partially reduced in that area!]<br>
Judging from the extent of the invasion, it was not yet at an irreversible level.<br>
However, if the scenario proceeds like this, leaving Washington alone, the city will truly become part of the 'Demon Realm'.<br>
As time goes by, the Demon Realm will expand and eventually the entire Earth will fall under the Demon King.<br>
That must be prevented at all costs.<br>
“What kind of demon king is it?”<br>
Now, let's go to the seventh scenario, the Washington Dome.<br>
The demon king will not be able to descend in person.<br>
Therefore, there was a high possibility that the owner of this dome was a subordinate of a specific demon king.<br>
"It was the time I ever heard this demon king."<br>
"Was it your first time hearing about it?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk knew the true names of all the demon kings who ruled the 72 demon worlds.<br>
The same would apply to the prophet in front of him.<br>
Nevertheless, if a demon king with a name they had never heard of appeared, the implications of that fact were clear.<br>
"Christina confirmed—"<br>
A new 'Demon King' has appeared in the Demon Realm in this round.<br>
"They called their master the 'Demon King of Salvation'."

699 Episode 25 Demon King (2)<br>
As if he had been waiting for him, the demon noble calmly turned toward the entrance of the Capitol.<br>
But Yoo Jonghyuk did not move a single step. His past lives were talking to him.<br>
That's a trap.<br>
Even if it wasn't a trap, he didn't believe anything the Demon King's liaison said.<br>
"Prophet."<br>
Anna Croft had no answer to Yoo Jonghyuk's call.<br>
When he glanced over, she saw Anna Croft staggering around, her complexion pale.<br>
"I don’t know why, but [Future Sight] doesn’t work."<br>
[Future Sight] doesn’t work. Even in his last round, Anna Croft's skills often broke down.<br>
But it was such an odd timing.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk analyzed Anna Croft's condition with calm eyes and made a quick decision.<br>
"You’re useless whenever it’s important."<br>
Before he knew it, the demon noble was more than twenty steps away.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk had already obtained information about this guy through [Sage's Eyes].<br>
'It's Viscount Nikhteri the .'<br>
This guy was a 'self-made '.<br>
Based on the original scenario difficulty, this guy should only appear in the eighth scenario.<br>
That guy said, 'The Demon King of Salvation is waiting'.<br>
Inside the Capitol, there is a real agent of the ' King'.<br>
Probably, the probability that there is an incarnation capable of being possessed by the Demon King is higher than the possibility that there is a symbolic body.<br>
In that case, he must be considered to be at least an earl-level Demon King.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk took a deep breath. With each breath, the magical power condensed in his entire body continued to rotate.<br>
In general, 'Iljucheon' refers to the circulation of the magic power contained in the Danjeon to all microscopic blood vessels.<br>
However, with his master, 'Iljucheon' was used with a different meaning.<br>
Only when the circulating magic draws a complete circle does the body become an eye in itself.<br>
Eyes that perceive the world through expanded five senses.<br>
Through those eyes, humans see the sky. You realize that the sky, which seemed beautiful and wide, was actually a prison in a terrible scenario.<br>
「"In fact, it is to recognize that this whole world is just a joke in the sky. That is Iljucheon, the entrance to Pacheon."」<br>
At this point, it was still difficult to count the stars in the sky. However, it was not difficult to count the demon species on earth.<br>
"A total of four?"<br>
Shocked, Viscount Nihterida looked back.<br>
Next, three stone statues radiated a gloomy light from above the stone building of the Capitol.<br>
[The evil Viscount 'Bricolakas' is hostile towards you.]<br>
[The evil Viscount 'Scupedia' is showing hostility towards you.]<br>
[The evil Viscount 'Myrmicoleon' shows his hostility towards you.]<br>
As many as four demon viscounts.<br>
In no round did he face four self-made demons at the same time in the seventh scenario.<br>
Coo coo coo coo coo.<br>
Anna Croft bit her lip as she felt the pressure of the demonic species pressing down on the area.<br>
"They are the demons who killed my comrades."<br>
Perhaps these demons were summoned in the fifth scenario. Starting from only the fifth scenario, it was obvious that no country could handle this level of difficulty.<br>
As Yoo Jonghyuk's eyes gave off a sharp light, the viscounts looked at each other as if they were curious.<br>
Coo coo coo coo.<br>
If it had been the previous round, or if it had been the round even before, Yoo Jonghyuk would never have confronted them. Fighting with four viscount-level fighters in the seventh scenario is tantamount to suicide.<br>
But Yoo Jonghyuk did not back down. Because this round was neither the 39th nor the 40th.<br>
This world is the 41st round.<br>
The moment Yoo Jonghyuk's body disappeared, the three Viscounts simultaneously drew their weapons towards Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
Brycolakas held the long incense stick that was his main weapon, Scoupedia held the dual-wielding daggers, and Myrmicleon held the swollen drumstick.<br>
Magical energy containing deep evil karma burst out in a semicircle around the three demons.<br>
, Yoo Jonghyuk's agility had reached the limit of the scenario. However, in the eyes of the demonic viscounts, it was a speed that wasn’t desirable.<br>
The viscounts' eyes were simultaneously nailed to a single point in the air.<br>
"Is it there?"<br>
The spear, dual-wielding daggers, and the drumstick struck a point in the air at the same time. The demonic viscounts laughed along with a cruel explosion sound. They thought Yoo Jonghyuk would have been crushed mercilessly.<br>
However, when the black ether that dyed the air black disappeared, Yoo Jonghyuk was not there.<br>
"What—"<br>
That couldn't have been possible. There was no way just one incarnation could avoid the eyes of a demon noble who had evolved.<br>
The moment when the demon Viscount Myrmicoleon sensed something was wrong, he opened his mouth.<br>
Skag.<br>
With a sound as if the world was splitting in two, the head of Demon Viscount Myrmicoleon was blown off.<br>
For the first time, agitation spread across the demons' faces.<br>
Let's say he’s just out of their sight. However, a viscount-level demon was killed in one blow.<br>
"It does not make sense—"<br>
But to the current Yoo Jonghyuk, it 'made sense'. The power he now manifests was obtained at a high price.<br>
['Restraint of Truth' is activated.]<br>
One of his three story imprints, 'The Redemption of Truth'.<br>
[Some of your memories are sealed.]<br>
'Story Engraving' that unleashes power in exchange for some of the memories from the previous round being sealed.<br>
[All your overall abilities will temporarily exceed the scenario limit!]<br>
[Explosive power surges from your entire body!]<br>
In Yoo Jonghyuk's mind, a memory he cherished was fading away. It was a memory he dedicated.<br>
「"Captain. This is a birthday present. It's my favorite toshi..."」<br>
Lee Hyunsung in the 22nd round, smiling with a simple face. The old toshi he handed him was disappearing from his mind. The temperature of his heart decreased and his heart became infinitely cold.<br>
Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk will never remember that smile again. Instead, Yoo Jonghyuk will remember something else.<br>
His long journey of regression has finally come to an end, a memory that will not disappear until the end of his life.<br>
「"Captain. Will you please take revenge in the next round?"」<br>
"I will grant your wish, Lee Hyunsung."<br>
He will remember only sorrow.<br>
I will fight against the sky of this world using the hatred born of that sadness as my driving force.<br>
"You! How dare you!"<br>
The demonic Viscount Scoupedia charged at him, brandishing his dual daggers. The pitch-black river that formed at the end of his weapons streaked Yoo Johyuk's cheek.<br>
But even faster than that, Yoo Jonghyuk had already pierced Scupedia's heart.<br>
Deep.<br>
Scoupedia, who vomited black blood, died. Vrycolakas and Nihterida, enraged, joined forces and rushed forward.<br>
It was an attack prepared to defeat Donggui.<br>
The Ammu created by Nihterida covered the field of vision, and Vrykolakas' long spear split into a dozen pieces and flew in from all directions. Several polearms grazed Yoo Jonghyuk's thighs and waist.<br>
Skag.<br>
Vricolakas' head fell.<br>
Now all that remained was the demonic Viscount Nihterida.<br>
Nihterida, who hesitated and retreated, said,<br>
"What are you doing? Why are you opposing us? The Demon King has no hostility towards you!"<br>
Nihterida, who had even thrown away his pride as a demon species, shouted in a panic.<br>
"Hmm, why would you do something like this? The 'Demon King of Salvation' will definitely be fine if you call him."<br>
Nihterida, realizing that the situation was unfavorable, looked at him then quickly turned back and began to run away.<br>
[The exclusive skill 'Suzaku Shinbo Lv.10' is activated!]<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk's thigh muscles wriggled like an animal once again. His footsteps pushed into the ground deeply with a loud noise. Yoo Jonghyuk concentrated his magic power by spinning it around in the air. [Pacheon Ganggi], which extended toward the sky with its centrifugal force.<br>
[The exclusive skill 'Flashlight Lv.8' is activated!]<br>
The magic power gathered turned into holy light and created a large hole in Nihterida's upper body.<br>
['Redemption of Truth' ends.]<br>
As soon as his magic power was exhausted, Yoo Jonghyuk took out the 'Advanced Magic Power Recovery Potion' from his arms and drank it.<br>
The liquid that fell seeped into his entire body.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk lightly wiped his mouth with a somewhat tired expression then immediately looked at the equipment items dropped by the demon species.<br>
'Ancient demon's necklace.'<br>
'Half armor of great strength.'<br>
'Ammu Belt.'<br>
All three were not bad pieces of equipment.<br>
The 'half armor of great strength', which increased strength, was suitable for Lee Hyunsung, whose main focus is hand-to-hand combat, and the 'ammu belt' was suitable for Yoo Jonghyuk himself to wear.<br>
'I guess I can give this to him.'<br>
The 'Ancient Demon's Necklace', which increases stun resistance, was for the guy who fainted frequently.<br>
It's useless in its current state, so filling it in would be of some help.<br>
Anna asked in bewilderment as she saw Yoo Jonghyuk standing up after finishing maintenance in an instant.<br>
"What on earth did you do?"<br>
"There is no part for you. You didn’t help in the battle."<br>
"That’s not what I’m talking about."<br>
In fact, Yoo Jonghyuk knew what had surprised Anna Croft.<br>
He was incredible. The level of prowess he had just shown was incomparable to any incarnation of the same scenario.<br>
"Did you really make a 'story imprint'? Have you forgotten what the villains who used it said?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk also knew the fate of those 'villains'. Some of them had their existence sealed because they could not find a way to get rid of it.<br>
"It’s about borrowing and writing a fictional 'story'. Its power will eat away at your soul and memories."<br>
"It’s none of your business."<br>
"What have you lost in return?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk did not answer, but Anna Croft knew what he had lost.<br>
「"Prophet. There is a necessary memory. Use [Future Sight]."」<br>
To a regressor, 'memory' is everything to existence.<br>
"Why did you do that... Sealed memories don’t come back! Now you’ve lost them forever. Do you even know what that means?"<br>
The disappeared worlds exist only through his memories, and he also maintains his identity by not forgetting those memories.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk gave his memories in return.<br>
"You will end up becoming someone else. You will not even know who you are."<br>
"You talk like you know who you are."<br>
As if any further conversation was meaningless, Yoo Jonghyuk began to walk away again. There were traces of the demons' blood in each of his footprints.<br>
Anna Croft stared blankly at the footprints he left behind.<br>
If he fails, what meaning will these footprints have?<br>
If there ever comes a moment when even she gives up reading her past with [Future Sight], then who will remember that long record of failures of that regressor?<br>
Should she make it difficult?<br>
"Wait a minute. Wait, King!"<br>
Anna Croft, who belatedly woke up from her thoughts, quickly followed Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
However, before he could walk even a short distance, Yoo Jonghyuk suddenly stopped walking. She didn't need to ask what was going on. This is because he someone walking out from inside the Capitol.<br>
A formidable magical energy that made his whole body tremble.<br>
"Run, Prophet."<br>
For the first time, Yoo Jonghyuk's expression hardened.<br>
"It’s a 'Marquis' level demon."<br>
*<br>
That's where Anna Croft's story ended.<br>
"Wait a minute. So what happened?"<br>
Wasn't some important information missing?<br>
What happened to Yoo Jonghyuk, who fought a marquis-level demon?<br>
If something like that happens, how can you be sure that your companions will be safe?<br>
So who is the 'Demon King of Salvation' over there?<br>
In the end, I couldn't bear it anymore and insisted.<br>
"Could it be that you threw Yoo Jonghyuk there and ran away alone?"<br>
"Before we continue, there’s something I need to ask you."<br>
I already knew what Anna Croft would 'ask'.<br>
In the first place, she started this story to earn time.<br>
The incarnations surrounding the outside of the living room from earlier were proof of this.<br>
Of course, no matter how many incarnations surrounded this place, it wasn't a big threat to me. That is, as long as the combat power of the incarnations is within the realm of probability.<br>
"We have 'tactical nuclear weapons'."<br>
"So?"<br>
Tactical nuclear weapon. It seemed like they had managed to secure modern weapons from the generation before the scenario.<br>
"You’re not planning on flying that thing at the Washington Dome, are you? You know there’s no point in doing something like that."<br>
A nuclear weapon with that level of destructive power cannot be activated due to the scenario structure.<br>
Perhaps the moment the launch button is pressed against the Washington Dome, the nuclear weapon will stop operating due to the probability aftereffects.<br>
But now, instead of launching a tactical nuclear weapon at the Washington Dome, she brought that weapon to me.<br>
"I heard from Christina that you are a 'family member' of the Demon King."<br>
Perhaps Anna Croft had made up her mind. If necessary, she will use that 'nuclear weapon' here.<br>
"Is the name of the Demon King you serve 'Demon King of Salvation'?"

701 Episode 25 Demon King (4)<br>
Christina pursed her lips and continued speaking.<br>
"I had to make decisions quickly," she said. "Too many people died before we even got to the fifth scenario."<br>
How did she manage to get to the fifth scenario?<br>
However, the apostles who knew the ending of this story knew that if the scenarios continued like this, everything would go wrong.<br>
The ultimate resolution of the scenarios were impossible in this world line where Kim Dokja does not exist.<br>
No matter how well they clear the previous scenarios, they will end up frustrated in front of the 'Final Wall'.<br>
So they decided to take a risk in the fifth scenario.<br>
Summoning the 'Demon King of Salvation' with the 'Disaster Summoning Rights'.<br>
Even if it was called crazy, it was a choice that I had nothing to say about.<br>
"What were you going to do if you failed?"<br>
"That..."<br>
"Besides, even if you succeed, it’s still a problem."<br>
If the 'Demon King of Salvation' had been summoned as a disaster, something truly absurd could have happened.<br>
Nevertheless, I could not find fault with the readers’ heart for looking for Kim Dokja at the most desperate moment.<br>
Maybe it's because I too had a similar experience like them.<br>
「"I will sign a contract behind the scenes."」<br>
Just like searching for God, anyone who knows Kim Dokja's name has no choice but to find him.<br>
This is probably the same for all readers who came to this world.<br>
I asked, looking down at Anna Croft, who was sleeping soundly on Christina's lap.<br>
"She was [hypnotized], so Anna doesn’t know the details of the situation."<br>
"Yes..."<br>
Anna Croft is the most cautious character in 'Ways of Survival'.<br>
There is no way she would suddenly agree to summoning a being that she has never heard of or seen, the 'Demon King of Salvation', as a disaster.<br>
In the end, Christina and the apostles hypnotized Anna and they secretly summoned the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
In return, the 'Washington Dome' became a demon realm.<br>
"At first, we were planning to do whatever we could to stop it. We gathered all the apostles in America and headed to the Washington Dome. That happened a few weeks ago."<br>
It would not have been possible to honestly say that Washington was destroyed because of their choices.<br>
To make up for their mistakes, the apostles attempted to attack the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
"You failed."<br>
"…Yes."<br>
"Is that why you brought me here?"<br>
"I’m ashamed."<br>
Christina must have thought the moment she confirmed my sponsor.<br>
The 'Demon King of Salvation' they were looking for was already in this world line, and maybe that's why their 'summoning' failed.<br>
"Is there really a 'Demon King of Salvation' in this world? Is there a 'Kim Dokja' we know?"<br>
Is there a 'Kim Dokja' they know in this world?<br>
I thought for a moment and answered like this.<br>
"There is a friend who is much more real than the 'Demon King of Salvation' over there. What on earth is the 'Demon King of Salvation' over there?"<br>
"I don’t know. What’s certain is that he wasn’t the 'Demon King of Salvation' that we know. And…"<br>
"And?"<br>
"The Demon King continued to grow stronger every time the apostles visited."<br>
Did he continue to get stronger every time the apostles visited him?<br>
There was a theory that came to mind, but I wasn't sure yet.<br>
But I have one person who can confirm all these hypotheses.<br>
'Kim-ssi.'<br>
This guy said he was going to exchange coins, but where on earth did he go?<br>
At that moment, with a chirping sound, 'Midday Tryst' was reconnected.<br>
'No, where did you go and why are you coming back only now?'<br>
—Youngest, I’m in big trouble.<br>
'A big problem happened here too.'<br>
I was trying to explain what incredible things have happened while he was away.<br>
However,<br>
—I think my modifier was stolen.<br>
It seemed like something really big had happened over there too.<br>
*<br>
Everything in the <Star Stream> is a 'story', that is, a 'tale'.<br>
However, since the concept of 'tale' seemed so abstract, 'currency', a practical processing of it, appeared.<br>
This is the story of the 'coin' we know.<br>
—Constellations spend coins just by breathing.<br>
'Do constellations need to breathe?'<br>
—It means that coins are consumed just by existing.<br>
'I know, but I didn't know that it costs money to maintain a modifier.'<br>
Since Kim Dokja never mentioned it once, I never thought about it either.<br>
I never thought it would cost coins just by using a modifier. Is that why the constellations have always been keen on earning coins?<br>
'But are you saying that your constellation modifier has been taken away?'<br>
—Not a constellation modifier.<br>
'Are you sure?'<br>
—I also have a Demon King modifier.<br>
According to Kim Dokja's claim, constellations that suddenly came from other 'world lines' like Kim Dokja had to pay additional fees to use the <Star Stream> system.<br>
However, Kim Dokja was both a 'constellation' and a Demon King, so the cost of maintaining the modifier was doubled.<br>
'How did you maintain the constellation modifier, but you couldn’t pay the cost of maintaining the Demon King modifier?'<br>
I wondered why this person was so obsessed with 'coins'…<br>
—I was thinking of exchanging some of the story fragments and monster parts I got this time and buying the modifier again... but the management bureau had already sold off my Demon King modifier.<br>
Suddenly I felt like I knew how things were going.<br>
I briefly explained to Kim Dokja about the events that occurred in the United States.<br>
When he heard the story about the apostles of the American continent and the 'right to summon disaster', Kim Dokja let out a sigh.<br>
—Oh, that was the spam message from the administration. They said it was a disaster blah blah blah.<br>
It looks like he didn't even read the management bureau's message.<br>
'Then the Demon King of Salvation who is currently in Washington...'<br>
—It’s probably the new 'Demon King of Salvation' that the Management Bureau has found.<br>
'This is the guy who bought the Demon King's nickname.'<br>
In other words, the 'Demon King of Salvation' currently in Washington is a counterfeit, 'Demon King of Salvation' in name only.<br>
'Is he also a 'Demon King'?'<br>
—It won’t be at the level of a Demon King. Because they have a lot of pride, they don't steal and use other people's modifiers. He's probably a demon trying to use this opportunity to ascend to the throne of the Demon King.<br>
No matter what the guy's identity was, for now I had no choice but to head to Washington.<br>
I had Christina wake Anna up and explain what was needed. Anna Croft looked very embarrassed, but she quickly calmly accepted the situation.<br>
"I’m angry, but I can’t help it. I’ll take strict action for this later, Christina."<br>
"I’m sorry, Anna."<br>
"Please swear an [Oath of Existence]. You will never [Hypnotize] me again."<br>
"I swear."<br>
Anna did not press Christina any further. Maybe it's because she knows that persecuting her now won't solve her situation.<br>
Anna had her artisans bring the completed '4th grade Earth Dragon' equipment.<br>
"You’ve caused trouble. Cheon Inho, let’s leave right away."<br>
After completing preparations, we immediately opened the portal to the 'Washington Dome'.<br>
As the situation got to this point, I too became confused.<br>
Are my companions still safe?<br>
What happened to Yoo Jonghyuk, who met a marquis-level demon species?<br>
How strong is the 'Demon King of Salvation' in the Washington Dome?<br>
The moment I sort out my complicated thoughts and stepped into the portal.<br>
[Someone has killed the ruler of 'Washington East'.]<br>
A message was heard.<br>
*<br>
The 'demon' had no name.<br>
[You are a 7th grade demon species 'Dark Sentinel'.]<br>
He, like most other demon species, existed only as a part of a scenario designed by dokkaebis. Killing the incarnations that come to the 'Treasure Storehouse of the Earth River Lord' and offering their souls to the demon kings.<br>
The demon had no complaints about it. Just as gopher rats never question their breathing, breathing black ether, and collecting treasures, he also never once questioned his work.<br>
The whole incident started with him killing some humans who were hiding in his 'treasure warehouse'.<br>
「"It is the Keeper of Darkness!"」<br>
「"It’s true. It’s just like the novel."」<br>
He dealt with the incarnations as usual. Attack using tentacles.<br>
But surprisingly, the duo skillfully repelled his attack.<br>
「"Through! Kim Dokja's method works! Push on!"」<br>
「"If you attack the left ankle, the upper right tentacle moves!"」<br>
Not only did humans know his attack patterns, but they also used weapons with 'divine attributes' to which he was vulnerable.<br>
He screamed every time his tentacle were cut.<br>
「"It’s over! Finish it!"」<br>
Looking back, if he had been an ordinary 'dark sentinel', he certainly would not have been able to withstand the attacks of that duo.<br>
But the duo was unlucky.<br>
The period of time he lived as a 'Dark Sentinel' was a little longer than other 'Dark Sentinels', and because of that, he was able to display a little more wisdom in battle than other entities.<br>
When he pretended to be weak and stumbled, the humans attacked him with great force. He did not miss the gaps between the humans and radiated pitch-black darkness.<br>
「"What? This is a pattern that didn’t exist before!"」<br>
「"Novels didn’t originally show detailed patterns! Damn it, run away!"」<br>
One of the duo was missed, but the other was caught in the tentacles and could not escape.<br>
「"Save me! Please save me!"」<br>
An obvious appeal that he had always heard.<br>
The demon, not interested in human tears, lightly pierced the human's heart with its tentacle. The man who was crying and bleeding out died.<br>
「It’s boring.」<br>
The moment that thought occurred to him, he was surprised at himself.<br>
「What is 'boredom'?」<br>
It's a feeling he's never had before.<br>
He suddenly lowered his head and looked down at the tip of his tentacle. There was a small doll statue that gave off a faint light.<br>
An item he had never seen before while living as a demon.<br>
As if he was possessed, he moved his tentacles and grabbed the doll, and countless emotions that he had never felt before came flooding back to him.<br>
A very precious, sad, and nostalgic feeling. What followed was a very strong appetite.<br>
He could not overcome his desire and eventually swallowed the doll.<br>
"What is 'I'?"<br>
That's how the demon recognized his existence for the first time.<br>
"I am the 'keeper of darkness'."<br>
No.<br>
That is not an accurate expression.<br>
"I am an 'extra'."<br>
Even though he didn't really understand what 'extra' was, he felt the nuance of the word.<br>
He wanted to know. What is this feeling?<br>
[You have evolved into a 5th grade demon species, 'Dark Seeker'.]<br>
He participated in the scenario and started hunting. He learned to fight from the humans who came to hunt him. He no longer fought like a 'Dark Sentinel'.<br>
He used weapons and wore equipment possessed by humans.<br>
「"Oh my god! It’s a 5th grade demon!"」<br>
「"There is no proper information about the Dark Seeker—"」<br>
「"Run! Everyone run!"」<br>
Just like that, one, two, three... killing people again and again.<br>
And very occasionally, he could get something from particularly strong humans.<br>
['Kim Dokja’s Fragment' has been acquired.]<br>
He didn't understand the meaning of the message, but he understood at least one thing.<br>
The more of these 'fragments' he acquires, the stronger he becomes.<br>
He began hunting humans at an increasingly faster rate. He became familiar with the habits of humans and learned their mannerisms.<br>
He set traps targeting humans looking for hidden items, and even deliberately disguised himself as a weak monster species.<br>
How many fragments could he have eaten that way?<br>
When he came to his senses, he had already become a demon noble.<br>
[You have evolved into a 'Demon Noble'.]<br>
And that 'being' came to visit him.<br>
[Wow, this is my first time seeing a devil like you.]<br>
A group called 'Administrative Bureau' by the public.<br>
[Don’t you want to have a 'name'?]<br>
The dokkaebi from the management bureau asked and he nodded.<br>
[If you give me all your Coins, I will give you a 'name'.]<br>
He willingly paid with the coins he had collected after killing the incarnations.<br>
[From now on, you are the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]<br>
That's how he became the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
When he actually heard it, he felt like it was a name that suited him very well. The stories boiling inside him were saying.<br>
「Collect the fragments.」<br>
「Become the one and only 'Kim Dokja'.」<br>
There was a feeling of elation welling up from deep within his soul.<br>
He will become the 'Demon King' of this world. He will break away from being an 'extra' and become a ‘being’ who longs for the real ◾️◾️.<br>
However, as if laughing at his efforts,<br>
"You’ve just ascended to the rank of marquis."<br>
The real hero of this story came to visit him.

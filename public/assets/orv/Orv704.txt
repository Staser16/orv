704 Episode 25 Demon King (7)<br>
Nirvana Moebius.<br>
A 'reincarnator' with the constellation 'Guardian of Mandala' as his sponsor.<br>
Like Anna Croft, he is a being who can preserve a certain amount of memory by resisting Yoo Joonghyuk’s [regression].<br>
He is the leader of the Salvation Church and was the 'counter' of Yoo Joonghyuk in the 3rd round.<br>
"Only live in the present!"<br>
He stomped his feet as the elephant bells thumped, accompanied by the cries of the Salvationists.<br>
"There is no salvation in the afterlife!"<br>
"What’s important is now!"<br>
"What must be liberated is 'today'!"<br>
As the ground vibrated like a giant drum, the incarnations of the area shook loudly.<br>
"W-what is it?"<br>
"Salvation Church? Dammit, they came?"<br>
Some of the incarnations were already aware of their existence, as some of them were preparing to withdraw the moment they saw the elephant monster.<br>
"I’m falling for it. I shouldn’t get involved with those crazy people."<br>
However, there were still some incarnations who remained and watched.<br>
Those who do not yet know much about the Salvation Church or are confident in their own abilities.<br>
"Nirvana, the leader of the Salvation Church."<br>
"Oh, prophet?"<br>
As Nirvana waved his hand happily, Anna Croft frowned and averted her gaze.<br>
Nirvana slowly approached us and opened his mouth.<br>
"Why did my Yoo Joonghyuk end up like that? Was it your fault?"<br>
"The King is not yours."<br>
"Answer me. What is that demon king who is entangled with my Yoo Joonghyuk?"<br>
"It’s none of your business."<br>
"If I don’t care, who care?"<br>
Nirvana declared, spreading his arms wide.<br>
"The relationship between me and Yoo Joonghyuk is connected by the wheel of eternity. You know because you secretly stole our story."<br>
Anna Croft turned away from Nirvana and glanced towards me.<br>
—Cheon Inho. You never met Nirvana in the last round, right?<br>
It was [electric sound].<br>
This is probably because she was wary of the existence of Nirvana.<br>
It wasn't strange.<br>
In this world, the only incarnations that know of Yoo Joonghyuk's [regressions] from the beginning are Anna Croft, who can use [Future Sight], and the reincarnated Nirvana.<br>
Therefore, the prophet and the reincarnator have no choice but to be endlessly wary of each other over Yoo Joonghyuk.<br>
"Why are you making such a fuss?"<br>
In an instant, Nirvana came right in front of her and suddenly stuck out his head.<br>
Also a reincarnator. Did he  notice the use of [electric sound]?<br>
The guy glared at Anna and craned his long neck to ask.<br>
"Who is this guy? Prophet, is this your new toy?"<br>
My face was captured in the guy's eyes that were shining with pure white light.<br>
"Why are you closing your eyes? Are you saying you don’t dare look at me?"<br>
The moment I was about to reply that I had been watching, his right arm moved directly towards my forehead.<br>
[Relationship story].<br>
I also knew that skill. A skill to read the other person's memories by weaving the bonds of stories with the power of the mandala.<br>
But someone blocked his movements.<br>
Quaaaaaaaaa!<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk's fist flew in in an instant and exploded into the guy's face.<br>
Nirvana, who had rolled dozens of times against his will, shouted while holding one side of his face.<br>
"Kaaaa! What are you doing, Yoo Joonghyuk!"<br>
A blow that would have exploded the head of a normal incarnation.<br>
However, in this round, Nirvana appears to have steadily increased his stamina and did not die even after being hit by Yoo Joonghyuk, who had become a beast.<br>
Nirvana, with black bruises on his face, cried out again as if he was aggrieved.<br>
"Yoo Joonghyuk!"<br>
Of course, Yoo Joonghyuk, unable to communicate, just growled and cried.<br>
"Where on earth are you looking? Look at me in front of you!"<br>
Enraged, Nirvana's hands began to move brilliantly.<br>
This guy's patented  was activated.<br>
[The incarnation 'Nirvana Moebius' activates 'Thousand-Armed Guanyin Lv.8'!]<br>
A dazzlingly rotating mandala settled behind the creature, and soon a thousand arms poured out like a waterfall around the mandala.<br>
"Look at me! Me! Look at me!"<br>
As the palms of Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara poured out and hit Yoo Joonghyuk’s head repeatedly, the beast's body began to sink to the ground little by little.<br>
"Oh, that’s—"<br>
"Is there also the leader of the Salvation Church?"<br>
"We too are joining!"<br>
I don't know how strong Nirvana will be when he grows up to the later scenarios.<br>
In the main story, while fighting against Kim Dokja, Nirvana was absorbed by the [Fourth Wall] and became a librarian at the library.<br>
But this world's Nirvana will never be absorbed by the [Fourth Wall].<br>
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is glaring at incarnation 'Nirvana Moebius'.]<br>
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' twitches his lips, saying that this incarnation is arrogant.]<br>
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is concerned about your safety.]<br>
A [reincarnator] that does not die even if he dies.<br>
[Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara] that overwhelms even Yoo Joonghyuk, who used [Giant Flower].<br>
In addition, there are mental abilities including [100 Torments] and [Eternal Nightmare].<br>
Even Yoo Joonghyuk, no matter how much of a beast he has become, might not be able to deal with the current Nirvana.<br>
"W-what!"<br>
I thought so.<br>
"He’s coming up!"<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk, who had been nailed to the ground by the blow of [Thousand-handed Avalokitesvara], began to stick his head out of the hole little by little.<br>
Quad deud deuk!<br>
A spear was held in the hands of Yoo Joonghyuk, who finally stuck his out, pushing up his body with his paws, little by little.<br>
Nirvana's eyes widened.<br>
"Yoo Joong—"<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk has lost his reason and only his instincts remain. Nevertheless, he was still a disciple of Breaking the Sky swordsman.<br>
I don't know about other people, but only Kim Dokja and I could recognize the skill.<br>
[Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship].<br>
A sword technique created to tear apart the constellations of this world.<br>
The swordsmanship extended into the sky.<br>
"Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck—!"<br>
Nirvana's [Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara] was torn apart by a blow that felt like a black lightning strike.<br>
The power that comes from pure differences in 'level'.<br>
The sky made of palms shattered, and the beast holding the spear let out a harsh cry toward the sky.<br>
Nirvana, spilling his blood, rolled around on the floor with half of his upper body blown away.<br>
I was almost daunted by the incredible scenery.<br>
'Shall we run away?'<br>
Does it make sense that that is just an incarnation of the 'seventh scenario'?<br>
Tsutsutsutsutsu.<br>
Sparks of probability began to rush through Yoo Joonghyuk’s whole body.<br>
ut. No matter how much he becomes the prey of a 'sub-scenario', the strength that exceeds the probability limit of the scenario cannot be sustained for a long period of time. If things continue like this, it won't be long before Yoo Joonghyuk’s whole body is burned by the aftermath.<br>
—Well.<br>
But Kim Dokja didn't seem to think so.<br>
—The balance of probabilities is not only determined through aftermath.<br>
Before I could ask what that meant, Nirvana, who was thought to be dead, suddenly stood up.<br>
[The incarnation 'Nirvana Moebius' activates 'Possession Lv.4'!].<br>
After all, a reincarnator is a reincarnator.<br>
In an instant, Nirvana's upper body, engulfed in lotus, began to regenerate rapidly.<br>
By reviving part of  own story,  physical defects were restored.<br>
Nearby, incarnations staggered and crawled towards Nirvana. They were the 'Salvationists' who followed .<br>
"Sect leader, I offer you my story."<br>
"My story..."<br>
Salvationists who suffered from [thought infection] volunteered to become sacrifices for the recovery of Nirvana.<br>
Nirvana, lightly holding their hands, nodded his head.<br>
"I will remember your story."<br>
That was the identity of the Salvation Church.<br>
All believers are merely pawns to complete the 'ultimate story' pursued by Nirvana.<br>
Nirvana, having regained  strength, took a deep breath and opened  mouth.<br>
"You are really strong in this round. It will be more rewarding to become one."<br>
"..."<br>
"I'm already looking forward to seeing what amazing stories you've built up... Wait a minute! Aren't I speaking to you! Kaaaaaaah!"<br>
I asked Kim Dokja as I saw Nirvana starting to get beaten up as soon as  recovered.<br>
'How much time is left now?  won't be able to last much longer.'<br>
—5 minutes.<br>
Nirvana, who was blocking Yoo Joonghyuk’s attack by spreading the palm of the Thousand-Armed Avalokitesvara, shouted.<br>
"Prophet! What are you doing? Help me quickly!"<br>
"How can I help you?"<br>
"I, become one with Yoo Joonghyuk— keaaaaaa!"<br>
"Even if I die, I won’t become one with you!"<br>
"Actually, I have no desire to become one with you!"<br>
Nirvana, who had been hit dozens more times in that short period of time, said as  blood flowed.<br>
"I don’t think that’s possible. I don’t want to further damage the body that will become one with me."<br>
"Wait a minute! Nirvana, you—"<br>
At the same time, the dark power of the story flowed from Nirvana's whole body.<br>
—Looks like that bastard will end up using it.<br>
Kim Dokja already seemed to know what technique he would use.<br>
Of course, so did I and Anna Croft.<br>
"Cheon Inho. We must stop it. The reincarnator will use [Eternal Nightmare]."<br>
[Eternal Nightmare].<br>
In the 3rd round in Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Yoo Joonghyuk fell victim to that technique.<br>
"Right now, Yoo Joonghyuk has activated two story imprints and is in a state of insanity. In such a situation, if he were to receive that stigmata—"<br>
"He’ll go crazy."<br>
"I know. If we don’t stop it now—"<br>
But even before we could move, Nirvana’s skill was already activated.<br>
"Yoo Joonghyuk. I don’t know why you looked like that."<br>
The nightmare of eons resided in the white-stained fingertips of this guy.<br>
"It doesn’t matter what you look like now. I can be anything. Man, woman, animal, monster! Only I can understand your eternity!"<br>
Nirvana's hand stretched out like a sword and touched Yoo Joonghyuk’s forehead.<br>
"So you too will understand me."<br>
And like magic, Yoo Joonghyuk’s movements stopped.<br>
Nirvana became proud and burst into laughter.<br>
"Hahahaha! Yoo Joonghyuk! Finally—"<br>
Slowly, Yoo Joonghyuk’s eyes turned towards Nirvana.<br>
"Yoo Joong—"<br>
With a fluttering sound, one of Nirvana's arms flew through the air.<br>
"Uh?"<br>
The moment Nirvana made a stupid expression,  other arm also flew in the air.<br>
"Kaaaaaaak!"<br>
The pain came late. Nirvana, whose arms were torn off in an instant, let out a desperate scream.<br>
Anna Croft, shocked, staggered back.<br>
I said, sighing inwardly.<br>
'As expected, it doesn't work for the current Yoo Joonghyuk.'<br>
—Yes.<br>
[Eternal Nightmare] is a technique that brings up the opponent's most terrible memories and traps them in those memories.<br>
But what if the 'opponent' is a beast with only instinct left?<br>
"Oh, how!"<br>
For example, if your mind has become so stupid that you cannot recall any memories.<br>
"Yoo Joonghyuk! Come to your senses! Your present—"<br>
Nirvana's left leg was crushed with a loud sound.<br>
"Kaaaaaaak!"<br>
A spark of probability flew once again. An ecstatic Nirvana crawled on the floor on  haunches.<br>
The black beast trampled on Nirvana's body and slowly looked around him.<br>
King.<br>
The man who suited that nickname better than anyone else cried out to the world.<br>
And with that one howl, all the incarnations here realized.<br>
[All incarnations of the 'Washington Dome' are terrified.]<br>
No volcano in the world can call itself 'king' in front of that monster.<br>
[The scales of probability are moving.]<br>
As long as it is 'incarnation'.<br>
—Youngest.<br>
I nodded.<br>
Even though Yoo Joonghyuk is showing off such a powerful personality, the probability of the <Star Stream> did not stop him.<br>
That said, the probability of this scenario is—<br>
[The exclusive skill 'Incitement Lv.10' is activated.]<br>
It means allowing the emergence of a strong person to stop that 'overlord'.<br>
[The third stage of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated.]<br>
Now it was the 'Demon king’s' turn to step forward.

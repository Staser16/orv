705 Episode 26 Star Ladder (1)<br>
With Yoo Jonghyuk's roar, the atmosphere of the battlefield changed. The frightened incarnations began to leave the battlefield one by one.<br>
[Someone uses the 'star ladder'!]<br>
[Someone uses the 'star ladder'!]<br>
This scenario was a 'sub-scenario' and did not necessarily need to be cleared.<br>
"Wait a minute, you guys—"<br>
Because they didn't come here to protect Washington in the first place.<br>
"I’m sorry, Prophet."<br>
As the allies she trusted disappeared one by one, Anna Croft's expression became anxious.<br>
The 'star ladder' in the sky continued to emit bright light.<br>
"Anna."<br>
Selena Kim and Christina stood by her side. Her colleagues also knew that there  chance of victory at this rate.<br>
Anna and Zarathustra's elites have already completed the subjugation of the 4 grade disaster species. They could also use that star ladder if they wanted to.<br>
Nevertheless, Anna did not leave the scenario.<br>
If she abandons Washington, America will collapse. The invasion of the demon world will continue and eventually hit Las Vegas.<br>
As the representative of 'Zarathustra', she had a duty to protect this continent.<br>
"Cheon Inho."<br>
Anna Croft looked at me.<br>
She was so desperate that she had to resort to her least favorite scammer.<br>
"I will stop it. Instead—"<br>
So, now was the only time for the scammer to set a 'condition'.<br>
"Please lend me some of your skills."<br>
"Which..."<br>
"I know you have the 'Elixir Maker' trait."<br>
The real reason I came to see Anna Croft.<br>
I took out the ´Lesser Dragon Heart' from her arms. A reward obtained from defeating a 4th grade earth dragon.<br>
However, because the processing process for Dragon Heart is so complicated, there is currently only one way to refine it into an elixir.<br>
"I need your blood."<br>
It is to mix it with the blood of the 'elixir manufacturer'.<br>
A startled Anna Croft stared at me closely and said.<br>
"You know what happens if you drink my blood."<br>
"I will become a member of your household."<br>
I said this, recalling Kim Dokja from the third round, who was revived after drinking Anna's blood.<br>
"But that’s when I’m of a lower rank than you."<br>
"Are you saying your level is higher than mine now?"<br>
Certainly, when I looked at me now, I was insignificant.<br>
I do not have a solid embodiment like Yoo Jonghyuk, nor do I have powerful mental skills like Nirvana.<br>
I do not lead a powerful group like Anna, nor do she have a sponsor that everyone knows about.<br>
But there is one thing I am confident about.<br>
[Story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is hungry.]<br>
'Stories.'<br>
"How can you—"<br>
Anna's eyes widened as she sensed the story flowing from my body.<br>
It has to be that way.<br>
Because I have already collected three stories. And exactly in those three stories, there was a clear difference in class between me and the other incarnations.<br>
"We don’t have time. What are you going to do?"<br>
Anna Croft still seemed hesitant.<br>
The fact that her 'blood' is an elixir is still a top secret. The moment this fact is revealed, incarnations from all over the world will target her.<br>
So for her to display this ability in front of me now was already a gamble.<br>
Anna, who was worried, eventually received the Dragon Heart.<br>
"It will take about 5 minutes. You are confident, right?"<br>
I stepped in front of her with my back to Anna.<br>
"Of course."<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, trampling on rvana, was crying towards the sky.<br>
[The attribute 'Cyclic Delay' is activated.]<br>
I slowly took a breath and circulated the magical energy throughout my body.<br>
—Youngest.<br>
'Yes. Is it possible now?'<br>
[Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint]’s cooldown has already ended.<br>
[Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint 'Stage 3' is in effect!]<br>
The problem was probability.<br>
Even if Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint was at level 3, it was not completely free from the influence of probability.<br>
—Is it possible.<br>
But it's different now.<br>
I knew it instinctively.<br>
Like when Yamata no Orochi descended on [Peace Land], the 'probability aftermaths' do not blow in their normal form in this scenario.<br>
In other words, this scenario works by putting each other's status on the 'scale' and canceling out each other's probabilities.<br>
Then.<br>
「This time, we may be able to use the true power of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.」<br>
I activated [Incite] at the right time.<br>
「I am Kim Dokja.」<br>
['Incite' goes hand in hand with 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'!]<br>
[The synchronization rate with the sponsor is increasing!]<br>
It feels like a layer of film is being placed on my soul, like wearing hard yet soft clothes.<br>
As I slowly blinked, the scenery of the world changed. The high sky became even lower, and the gaze of the constellations felt more blatant.<br>
[Some constellations are surprised by your ]<br>
[The constellations of the National Tree pay homage to your .]<br>
[The constellation 'Bald General' is surprised as to whether you actually have hidden powers.]<br>
[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is looking closely at your story.]<br>
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' looks at you with his eyes wide open.]<br>
Christina, who was standing a few steps away, stumbled.<br>
As for her, if she really is an 'apostle', she will have no choice but to recognize who is possessing me now.<br>
"As expected of you…"<br>
Finally, Yoo Jonghyuk looked this way. The moment our eyes met, I knew the bastard would move.<br>
"Come, Yoo Jonghyuk."<br>
At the same time as control of the body was transferred to Kim Dokja, 'Unbreakable Faith' flashed in the air.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk's flying front foot and the brilliantly rising 'Blade of Faith' collided with each other.<br>
Coo coo coo coo!<br>
The blade and forepaw collided and a loud noise erupted.<br>
I was taking the attack from that monstrous beast.<br>
—Woah! Are you that surprised? Even if I look like this, I am  grade'.<br>
I realize it again.<br>
That playful 'neighborhood brother' is actually a shining 'constellation' in the sky.<br>
—I cannot properly use even 10% of my power in this incarnation.<br>
To be exact, even that '10%' was difficult.<br>
The muscles of my entire body were screaming, and I could feel my magic power quickly depleting in real time.<br>
—The decision will be made within 5 minutes.<br>
The tale began to tell its story on Kim Dokja’s behalf.<br>
[The story 'King of a Kingless World' begins its storytelling !]<br>
The first story obtained by Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
「No king under the heavens of this world can call himself true.」<br>
The 'King of a Kingless World' was declaring to the 'Supreme King'.<br>
「Only the king who denies the king will exist.」<br>
The power of the story exploded and I kicked the ground and ran. I felt confident that I could cut down anything that got in my way.<br>
'Blade of Faith’ expanded explosively.<br>
For the first time, a hint of confusion appeared in the eyes of that scary beast.<br>
Sugagak.<br>
The cut off black fur fluttered in the air and blood splattered. Yoo Jonghyuk's stance, which was focused on attack, was changing.<br>
A cautious defensive stance centered on [Strong Self-Defense].<br>
In that brief moment, the beast made a decision. This 'story' cannot be used for very long.<br>
'Is it smart?'<br>
Even Yoo Jonghyuk was instinctively suppressing the story of the 'Supreme King'.<br>
As if he knew that the moment he used that story, 'King of Kingless World' would be used.<br>
All he uses are 'beast' techniques that rely solely on instinct.<br>
—I don’t know if Yoo Jonghyuk is smart or if the demon possessing him is smart.<br>
The story of 'King of a Kingless World' was spreading in real time.<br>
As he expected, my incarnation body could not maintain the power of a legendary story for long.<br>
'What should I do now?'<br>
—We have to use other means.<br>
Other means?<br>
The moment I was about to ask what else there was, a message rang in my head.<br>
A sigh flowed from within.<br>
This is the technology that made 'Kim Dokja' into a 'reader'.<br>
He defeated numerous enemies with this technique and absorbed their power as his own.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]<br>
In my head, I ran through a list of countless characters that Kim Dokja had read about so far.<br>
Some characters I knew, some I didn't even know.<br>
Some characters were too weak to be appropriate for use at the moment, while others were so strong that it was impossible to know if probability would allow it.<br>
—There are people to choose from.<br>
However, there was no hesitation in Kim Dokja's choice.<br>
[Bookmark number 11 has been activated!]<br>
—If this guy is the '41st round', there is someone who must be chosen.<br>
I felt like the magical energy in my whole body was shaking violently and I got goosebumps.<br>
I realized who I had become.<br>
「The pure white coat was covered with white fur.」<br>
I never thought I would see this scenery with my own eyes.<br>
[Bookmark number 11 'Disaster of Floods Shin Yoosung' is activated!]<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Beast King’s Sensitivity Lv.???'is activated!]<br>
White fur fluttering like white snow.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk's pupils wavered as he looked this way. Even someone with only instincts would have noticed.<br>
No matter how strong the beast-turned-guy is, he can't defeat me now.<br>
「"I am the 'Beast Lord'."」<br>
Shin Yoosung, the Disaster of Floods.<br>
「"King of all 'monsters'."」<br>
Kim Dokja rushed over in an instant and hit Yoo Jonghyuk on the head with the side of the blade.<br>
One shot, two shots, three shots.<br>
Even though it seemed like an attack that could be easily avoided, Yoo Jonghyuk could not avoid it. Like a subject who cannot disobey the king's orders.<br>
Every time Yoo Jonghyuk's head was hit, 41st Shin Yoosung's story was told.<br>
「"What on earth were we to the captain?"」<br>
「"I hate you for living alone in this world."」<br>
「"I will end your world in the most horrific way."」<br>
No matter what anyone says, they cannot say that this pain is a lie.<br>
41st round Shin Yoosung's very existence was the crime of 41st round Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
As if receiving punishment for his crime, Kim Dokja delivered a powerful kick to Yoo Jonghyuk's stomach.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk flew about ten meters and fell, breaking the window of the National Assembly building.<br>
「"Ahjussi… Can I call you that too?"」<br>
The moment Kim Dokja heard that voice again, he stopped.<br>
Whose memory is this?<br>
Shin Yoosung, or Shin Yoosoung in the 41st round?<br>
Or not,<br>
'Are you okay?'<br>
Is this a memory of Kim Dokja, who was the 'Demon King of Salvation'?<br>
—What if I’m not okay?<br>
For the first time, I felt a certain emotion in Kim Dokja's voice.<br>
He spoke like a person who does not want to let go of those emotions.<br>
'Isn't it okay to say that I miss her when I miss her?'<br>
Why is he so cold? Was the Kim Dokja I knew really that kind of person?<br>
No.<br>
At least the 'Demon King of Salvation' I know is...<br>
—Because that’s not my 'role'.<br>
Role?<br>
—It’s up to the other 'Kim Dokja' to feel sad when he sees people.<br>
The moment I heard those words, all my questions suddenly seemed to make sense.<br>
When he first saw Jung Heewon, Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, and Shin Yoosung.<br>
The reason why the words Kim Dokja used to call them felt somehow distant and unfamiliar, could not be—<br>
'Why is that?'<br>
Any Kim Dokja has the right to be sad. It's nice to see someone you like and you can call them in a friendly way.<br>
You can talk about your feelings.<br>
But he didn't do that.<br>
—Because I am the 'first Kim Dokja Kim'.<br>
Kim Dokja was looking at Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, the beast that rose up from inside the Capitol, ran screaming.<br>
He said, "Kim Dokja likes 'Ways of Survival'."<br>
If seen from afar, it would have looked like black and white monsters swinging their claws at each other.<br>
「Kim Dokja is more cold-hearted than anyone else.」<br>
At the moment when Yoo Jonghyuk's claws caught on the tip of the fur of the 'Beast King's sensitivity', 'Unbreakable Faith' radiated light.<br>
「Kim Dokja, who hates losses and hates constellations.」<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk stumbled after being hit.<br>
Kim Dokja pushed forward without giving him any time to rest.<br>
「In order for all other 'Kim Dokjas' to exist, Kim Dokja had to survive before anyone else.」<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, who was on the defensive, activated his skill.<br>
[Pacheonyuseonggyeol].<br>
The strongest skill that Yoo Jonghyuk can use now was revealed.<br>
A bundle of force that tears the world apart poured towards me.<br>
「Kim’Dokja chose to become the Demon King to save someone.」<br>
Kim Dokja was not embarrassed and slowly opened his arms. As if embracing a shattered world.<br>
['Monster Gate' is activated.]<br>
Dozens of portals swirled in the air, and disaster-level monster species popped out at the same time.<br>
The various breaths that poured out from the mouth of the monster species offset the bundle of strong energy of the broken meteor shower.<br>
「He is the 'Demon King of Salvation'.」<br>
As he slowly approached, a feeling of fear appeared in the black beast's pupils.<br>
Kim Dokja smiled faintly, as if to appease Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
"I’ll just take what’s mine back."<br>
The 'Kim Dokja fragment' that was stuck in Yoo Jonghyuk’s back was pulled out along with blood.<br>
And at that very moment, the forgotten memories of the 'Demon King of Salvation' returned.

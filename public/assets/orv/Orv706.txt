706 Episode 26 Star Ladder (2)<br>
I looked at Kim Dokja in the window of a broken building.<br>
He was standing there with Cheon Inho's face, but he was still a Kim Dokja.<br>
The first Kim Dokja of this world.<br>
He existed before any Kim Dokja.<br>
He was courageous to live, so he decided to keep or not keep things.<br>
He chooses and decides before all Kim Dokjas.<br>
He is the most responsible.<br>
「Kim Dokja's salvation is cruel.」<br>
The Demon King of Salvation.<br>
「The person who was saved by him is injured as if he saved a person who was drowned by the tip of the knife.」<br>
for saving someone. He was  by the people he saved for hurting them.<br>
「"I tell you not to be funny... What is this salvation..."」<br>
But the people who were so saved knew.<br>
「Why are you? "」<br>
They saw Kim Dokja's hand when  his sword.<br>
「The reader has a lot of scars in his hand.」<br>
When Kim Dokja saved someone with the tip of the knife, he also had a blade.<br>
「"Don't worry. If I die once and survive, it will disappear."」<br>
The wounds of the hand quickly disappeared, but people remembered the wound.<br>
I checked his hand over and over again, and I was relieved to see his hand.<br>
One day, Kim Dokja accepts that he will save them again with his hands.<br>
'Constellation-nim.'<br>
The Demon King of Salvation was looking down at his hand.<br>
The hand was my hand, so there was no scar.<br>
What memory had he regained?<br>
Even though I used [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint] I did not see his memory.<br>
'Constellation-nim?'<br>
Kim Dokja, who raised his head at my question, looked up at the sky.<br>
His smile’s meaning was unknown. It seemed broken, bitter, or seemed to understand everything.<br>
"One more."<br>
With that expression, Kim Dokja grabbed the head of a black beast. And with the other hand, he began to draw his own fragments on the back of the beast.<br>
"One more."<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk predecessor trembled as if he had seizures every time the fragments that were stuck on his back disappeared.<br>
Oh oh oh oh!<br>
With the painful roars that burst out of the beast's mouth, the people who heard it moaned.<br>
"Ahhh…"<br>
"What the hell—"<br>
People were now watching the Demon King of Salvation, not the Black Beast.<br>
People's expressions reflected in my eyes sharing his view.<br>
Watching me, walking back, fearing me, and running away.<br>
Kugu Gugu!<br>
I once again called Kim Dokja.<br>
'Constellation-nim!'<br>
Kim Dokja didn’t answer. He just recovered the fragments from Yoo Jonghyuk’s back.<br>
Three, four, five...<br>
More than half of the fragments were now recovered.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, who was on his knees, looked up at me with half-empty pupils.<br>
Suddenly I felt ominous.<br>
「Only one Kim Dokja.」<br>
Perhaps all Kim Dokjas dream of a single Kim Dokja.<br>
Then that 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
Wouldn't he want to be a single 'Kim Dokja', which was the first.<br>
"Don't move."<br>
Kim Dokja, who lifted the black beast's head with his left hand, bent his knees as if he was overpowering him. Subsequently, he continued to extract the fragments with his right hand.<br>
Every time the fragments were pulled out, more and more memories were coming back.<br>
His memories were his stories.<br>
As the stories come back, the power of the Demon King of Salvation becomes stronger.<br>
Tsutsutsutsu!<br>
Now it was really dangerous.<br>
The demon that was tired of Kim Dokja’s beating was completely silent.<br>
But Kim Dokja did not leave him alone.<br>
"Stop it and come out. If you don't want to die."<br>
In a word, the soul of the demon that had been harassing us so far came out from Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
Oh oh oh oh!<br>
The demon, who lost his place to go, shed a story like a flame.<br>
「I didn't have any bad intentions. I didn't have any bad intentions.」<br>
He was incredibly shabby for a marquis-level demon.<br>
「Please save me. Please save me.」<br>
The demon continued to talk as if he were Kim Dokja.<br>
「I just. I just ...」<br>
Kim Dokja said to such a demon.<br>
"You would have wanted to be the Demon King of Salvation."<br>
The soul didn’t reply.<br>
"Do you still want to be the 'Demon King of Salvation'?"<br>
The soul trembled once again.<br>
"Then come here."<br>
As Kim Dokja opened his mouth, the demon's soul was sucked into my mouth. It wasn't in me. I could sense it. The demon’s soul was absorbed into the story of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
When the demon disappeared, Yoo Jonghyuk, who lost his consciousness, became limp.<br>
'Kim Dokja.'<br>
I finally called Kim Dokja. If he did not answer this time, I would forcibly release Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint. However<br>
—I'm listening.<br>
Kim Dokja replied.<br>
—I thought about the old days.<br>
I was a little relieved because Kim Dokja was still the 'Demon King of Salvation' that I remember.<br>
'Did you regain your memory?'<br>
His appearance of ruthlessly extracting fragments was not forgotten.<br>
What kind of memory did Kim Dokja see to lose his reason?<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' makes a dissatisfied look.]<br>
Even the fragments were not absorbed by my stories.<br>
In other words, it meant that the Demon King of Salvation had absorbed all eight 'Kim Dokja fragments'.<br>
—That…<br>
The moment Kim Dokja tried to say something in a bitter voice.<br>
Tsutsutsutsutchut!<br>
Sparks began to drive in the air and lightning struck the ground.<br>
Is there a probability aftermath?<br>
It could not be. This scenario would be a safe zone in the aftermath.<br>
Is the price of the Demon King of Salvation transcending the scenario’s standard?<br>
My body was trembling in jeopardy. Even though I used [Omniscient Readers' Viewpoint], I could not afford the price of the Demon King of Salvation.<br>
But that's... no, wait a minute.<br>
Kurreung!<br>
Once again, some incarnations were approaching this side.<br>
The incarnations who have been watching the situation so far.<br>
As soon as he confirmed the '4th grade Earth Dragon' equipment they had, Kim Dokja frowned at them.<br>
Zarathustra?<br>
"James. What are you trying to do now?"<br>
Anna Croft blocked them. She was embarrassed by his actions as Zarathustra's sudden behavior was unexpected.<br>
"I'm trying to run 'prophecy.' Why?"<br>
"Prophecy? I have never told you of prophecy."<br>
"I know. I'm tired of your prophecy now."<br>
The man called James grumbled and looked back on other incarnations.<br>
"I was used because I had no strength. I was trampled by the monster. All of us are tired."<br>
"What do you want to say?"<br>
"We have made a contract."<br>
The woman at the back of James came forward and said.<br>
"Anna Croft, like you."<br>
Anna, who looked dazzled, muttered as she shook her head.<br>
"No way ... what are you—"<br>
[The constellation 'Bald General' is astonished at the choice of the incarnation!]<br>
[The constellation 'Maritime War God' is question his eyes!]<br>
[The constellation 'King Heungmu the Great' shouts that you are insane!]<br>
However, even the dissatisfied constellations could not dare to take a gesture beyond indirect message.<br>
The nebula, which exists behind the incarnations now, was a group of great-grade constellations.<br>
[Nebula <Asgard> watches the scenario.]<br>
The night sky of the highest star stream. One of their highest seats.<br>
Only an indirect message rang, but there was a strong pressure.<br>
Some incarnations had difficulty  and knelt down to the ground.<br>
Anna Croft, who lost her c, shouted at Zarathustra’s members.<br>
"Do you know what the hell you did? You are now—"<br>
"Asgard's representative incarnation."<br>
The woman laughed and talked.<br>
"So far, the representative incarnation of 'Asgard' was one of you, but—"<br>
James received her words.<br>
"Now it's not."<br>
At the same time, the light rose from ten Zarathustra’s members.<br>
I realized what happened.<br>
They chose to be the incarnations of Asgard.<br>
[Incarnation James Johnson receives the will of the nebula 'Asgard'.]<br>
[Incarnation Olivia Harris receives the will of the nebula 'Asgard'.]<br>
[Incarnation Harper Davis receives the Will of the nebula 'Asgard'.]<br>
The dazzling light shone onto ten incarnations.<br>
"<Asgard>! Save us!"<br>
"We have kept our promise! Now liberate us from this terrible scenario!"<br>
Anna urgently shouted at them.<br>
"No! Stop!"<br>
The incarnations of Zarathustra opened their arms towards the sky. Soon their bod began to oxidize in the light.<br>
The incarnations who realized that something was wrong too late struggled and shook  hands and feet, but the situation was already irreversible.<br>
"Uh, why—"<br>
"Aaaaaa!"<br>
The skin of the incarnation was scattered with ash powder.<br>
And.<br>
[The constellation 'Cleanser' descends!]<br>
The stars began to descend into their bodies.<br>
[The constellation 'The One Who Married Three Times' descends!]<br>
[The constellation 'Valkyrie's Daughter' descends!]<br>
…<br>
The constellations that entered the bodies of the incarnations opened their eyes one by one.<br>
Half-body advent.<br>
Again, it was only the seventh scenario. The great constellations attempted a half-descent in the seventh scenario.<br>
It was impossible.<br>
Even if it was to match the 'balance of probability', which was destroyed by the Demon King of Salvation.<br>
"No, run away!"<br>
The incarnations who confirmed the situation began to run away without looking back.<br>
It was natural.<br>
The half-body advent of the constellations was shocking enough to turn over the entire scenario.<br>
So I was not worried.<br>
[The Management Bureau is urgently involved in the region.]<br>
The management bureau cannot intervene in this situation.<br>
[The sub scenario’s probability is suspended.]<br>
[The probability of the <Star Stream> moves.]<br>
[The management country is in contact with Asgard.]<br>
The situation could not be resolved in the yard by the management bureau.<br>
But why is it?<br>
The half-body advent of the constellations was not solved.<br>
[Nebula <Asgard> declares 'Kinunggaf' all over the scenario area.]<br>
Subsequently, a shocking system message was heard.<br>
[Giant story 'ong' start its storytelling.]<br>
['Stage' occurs.]<br>
The sky in the area swirled and all the lights of the sky turned off.<br>
Longhouses.<br>
(TL: No sure about this name.)<br>
I also knew that name.<br>
The first empty space where the myth of Asgard began.<br>
The first void where there was no scenario and no story.<br>
If the nebula allowed the stage, the meaning was obvious.<br>
— going to hide what happens here now.<br>
But why did they suddenly have such a great transfer?<br>
No matter why the nebula <Asgard> does this, it is a huge blow to the giant story of the nebula.<br>
Nevertheless, doing this meant that there was something to get even if they lose money.<br>
Ten seats, including Valkyrie's daughter, were looking at us.<br>
[We finally met, 'Demon King of Salvation'.]<br>
The moment I heard that, I thought I understood.<br>
「Asgard knows about the Demon King of Salvation.」<br>
If this scenario was planned from the beginning.<br>
「Why did the demon appearing in Washington impersonate the 'Demon King of Salvation?」<br>
Suddenly everything felt clear.<br>
「If this scenario is a scenario created to attract the ''Demon King of Salvation. '」<br>
If the Dark Sentinel impersonating the Demon King of Salvation, Yoo Jonghyuk becoming a black beast, and all the rest was someone's plan.<br>
If so, their goal was clear.<br>
「The nebula of this world already gathering 'Kim Dokja’s fragments'.」

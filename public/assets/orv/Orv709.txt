709 Episode 26 Star Ladder (5)<br>
As the chatter of <Asgard> subsided, the sky over Ginnungagap was covered in silence again.<br>
A sky where no star dares to shine.<br>
It was not simply because the veil of 'Ginnungagap' hid the starlight. Beyond that veil, there was a being that caught the light of all the stars.<br>
Kim Dokja burst into laughter under his breath.<br>
"Look, you can’t do that."<br>
The great constellations remained silent, unable to respond to those words.<br>
They probably felt it too.<br>
Just now, a constellation from <Asgard> fell from beyond the sky of 'Ginnungagap'. I don't know what the constellation's modifier or true name is. However, judging from the reactions of the great constellations, it seems that he is not a weak guy.<br>
That constellation fell all at once.<br>
'Is Yoo Jonghyuk over there?'<br>
Kim Dokja looked up at the sky without answering.<br>
What Kim Dokja can see, I can also see. However, Yoo Jonghyuk was not visible in Kim Dokja's eyes. All that was reflected in my eyes was a landscape that looked like a pitch-black blackout curtain.<br>
—There is.<br>
Still, we could imagine.<br>
The fragments recovered by Kim Dokja were talking to us.<br>
「"Kim Dokja. Are you there?"」<br>
It was a voice from the distant past.<br>
Words that his colleagues once searched for him with.<br>
「"Dokja-ssi."」<br>
「"Ahjussi! Can you hear me? Ahjussi!"」<br>
Since this world line did not allow communication with them, their voices were nothing more than auditory hallucinations created by Kim Dokja's memories.<br>
Still, we knew. Even if the voice is different, even if the pitch and content of the words are different, <Kim Dokja Company> is looking for Kim Dokja beyond the stage.<br>
Because this is 'that kind of story'.<br>
—In the end, all that remains is the story.<br>
This story is all about Kim Dokja.<br>
'Do you miss them?'<br>
The agitation felt like a faint ripple and then subsided.<br>
—I told you. That's not my responsibility.<br>
Suddenly my emotions soared.<br>
I wanted to tell the Demon King of Salvation.<br>
You don't have to be that kind of person. There is no reason why you have to be the only 'Kim Dokja' like that.<br>
But on the other hand, I understood what he was saying.<br>
His story was telling.<br>
「This is the way of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.」<br>
He can only say that. From the time he was born, he had no choice but to live like that.<br>
Just like that stubborn Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
At that moment, this thought occurred to me.<br>
If every 'Kim Dokja' had his own role. If you live a story appropriate for that role.<br>
So what is my role as 'Kim Dokja'?<br>
['Kim Nonggaf' will be lifted soon.]<br>
The pitch-black sky was shaking.<br>
The first thing that came to me was relief that I had survived.<br>
When this 'stage' is lifted, the constellations will no longer be able to harm us.<br>
Even if it was a scenario where the scale of probability was at play, even if the opponent was <Asgard>, one of the three powers of the 'Nebula', there was no way they could have suffered a bigger loss than this.<br>
However, the great constellations showed no sign of giving up yet.<br>
[Don’t bluff. No great being can cross that veil now.]<br>
Valkyrie's daughter was right.<br>
In order for the Yoo Jonghyuk I know to descend here, at least a mythical constellation would have to appear and balance the scales.<br>
But there is no way that 'Odin' would appear here just to catch us.<br>
"That means the constellations can’t come to help you."<br>
[There is no need for help from other constellations. Because we alone are enough to hunt you down.]<br>
"The three of them were torn apart earlier."<br>
At those words, a bright roar flowed from 'Valkyrie's Daughter', who inherited the status of the seven great constellations.<br>
[I know what the 'old you' looked like.]<br>
The old Kim Dokja?<br>
[I have seen it several times in the stories of the mythical constellations that hunted you. It was so fascinating that I couldn't help but watch it over and over again. In that story, you were truly beautiful.]<br>
I was wondering.<br>
Is Kim Dokja's true identity really as they claim?<br>
Even if it remains as a 'story', there is no guarantee that the incident was true.<br>
In some stories, the facts are contaminated by false propaganda.<br>
'Valkyrie’s Daughter' continued speaking in a cold voice.<br>
[You are imitating God well despite the skin that God has shed.]<br>
Those words struck my heart in a strange way.<br>
"Imitate."<br>
The Demon King of Salvation laughed without denying those words in any way.<br>
The air around us began to vibrate. Seven constellations, led by 'Valkyrie's Daughter', were approaching with all their might.<br>
'Ginnungagap' is not over yet.<br>
'What are you going to do?'<br>
Three constellations have already left. The remaining great constellations will now risk their life to attack.<br>
'If I use that skill one more time—'<br>
—Then you’ll die.<br>
I know. But there is no other way.<br>
—There is a way.<br>
'Valkyrie's Daughter' flew into the air and threw out a spear, spewing out chills. A fierce gust of wind struck my waist as if the space around me was being compressed.<br>
It's enormous.<br>
Even if it is not a mythical-grade attack, if it is an attack of this level, one hit will kill me instantly.<br>
Even in that situation, Kim Dokja was still smirking.<br>
"Seven of you attack someone with nothing but fault? If we do this, we’ll have no choice but to call our side."<br>
[There is no one on your side here—]<br>
Kim Dokja put his hand into his chest and threw something toward the front.<br>
Acrid smoke spread out with a small explosion sound.<br>
'Poison bomb.'<br>
It was a trophy obtained when dealing with the Misreading association guys in the Star Labyrinth.<br>
Naturally, it was an item that would not cause any harm to the constellations.<br>
[With just this insignificant skill!]<br>
"Miscellaneous skill?"<br>
The constellations, startled by Kim Dokja's words, stopped for a moment.<br>
Then, instead of running straight this way, they started creating wind pressure to blow away the smoke from the poisonous bomb.<br>
They suspected that Kim Dokja might have set a trap.<br>
But that was exactly the effect Kim Dokja was aiming for.<br>
"Anna Croft."<br>
Anna Croft, who was standing in the back, trembled at Kim Dokja's call.<br>
Kim Dokja said, reaching out his hand toward her.<br>
"Heart."<br>
The processing of the 'Lesser Dragon’s Heart' that I requested earlier has just been completed.<br>
Valkyrie's daughter, who witnessed the scene, warned.<br>
[Prophet! What are you trying to do now!]<br>
Anna Croft's movements stopped at the bloody voice.<br>
[I'm sure you're not trying to betray <Asgard>.]<br>
At those words, both Anna Croft Selena Kim and Christina Page who were by her side turned pale.<br>
[Have you forgotten whose incarnation you are?]<br>
The reason 'Zarathustra' was able to become as strong as it is now is because of the support of the nebula <Asgard>.<br>
Helping me in a situation where I and <Asgard> were at a loss was tantamount to betraying the Nebula behind her.<br>
Anna Croft's 'Eye of the Great Evil' was seen turning red for a moment.<br>
Tsutsutsu.<br>
Anna Croft stumbled, frowning as sparks flew through the air.<br>
She attempted to read the future with [Future Sight]. Judging by the expression on his face, [Future Sight] probably failed.<br>
Anna Croft, who looked at us for a moment, lowered her head and said.<br>
"I am definitely the incarnation of <Asgard>."<br>
I understood.<br>
In the seventh scenario, it was obvious what the price would be for betraying the third-tier giant Nebula.<br>
If she helps us now, Anna's group will be defeated. So her judgment now was extremely reasonable<br>
"But."<br>
Anna Croft slowly raised her head, looked at 'Valkyrie's Daughter' and continued her words.<br>
"I’m not sure if you can represent <Asgard>."<br>
The moment I looked into Anna Croft's eyes, I slowly got goosebumps.<br>
I forgot for a moment.<br>
That she is a 'gambler in Las Vegas'.<br>
[What are you saying now?]<br>
"This stage is from the beginning, 'Ginnungagap', what happened here is not recorded. Since it is not handed down, no one outside can know what happened here."<br>
Anna Croft has just placed a bet.<br>
"If you all die here, who will remember what I did?"<br>
[What nonsense are you talking about, prophet!]<br>
A gamble with little chance.<br>
A situation in which a normal 'Anna Croft' would never have intervened.<br>
And yet now, Anna Croft has placed her entire stake on the conman she hates the most.<br>
"Cheon Inho. Can you do it?"<br>
I don’t know if Cheon Inho can do it or not. However, it was not Cheon Inho who was answering now.<br>
"I i possible."<br>
The constellations realized something was wrong and shouted.<br>
[Attack!]<br>
In the meantime, we received the 'Refined Lesser Dragon Heart' from Anna Croft.<br>
I wanted to ask her.<br>
Why did you decide to help us?<br>
In a situation where there is no future in sight, what on earth did you believe and bet on us?<br>
"In no round was I recognized as a 'companion' by the Supreme King."<br>
Anna Croft's gaze was focused on the fallen Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
"If such a powerful king recognized you as a comrade, there must be a good reason."<br>
Anna Croft had a feeling that this round was the end of the world lines. Therefore, she may also have taken her last gamble.<br>
"Jonghyuk has an eye for people."<br>
The constellations that cleared away the poisonous fog each fired their weapons.<br>
The one that flew first was again the spear fired by 'Valkyrie’s Daughter'.<br>
The thunderous strike contained in the weapon flew over, turning the entire floor over.<br>
[Kill! Recover the fragments!]<br>
Kim Dokja dodged the spear immediately swallowed the 'lesser dragon’s heart'.<br>
[Use 'Refined Lesser Dragon’s Heart'.]<br>
My heart was beating loudly and my body was shaking violently. The magical power emanating from the dragon's heart was merging with my heart. Like the fable of a chrysalis becoming a butterfly, I felt my body breaking through its limits.<br>
[Your body evolves!]<br>
[The story of the 'Braqui Clan' dwells in your heart.]<br>
But the opponents were constellations.<br>
It was not possible to overcome the defense just by absorbing a single 'lesser dragon's heart' and increasing the amount of magical power.<br>
The weapon that had passed us was flying back to us across the distant sky.<br>
Considering that the range of the lightning discharged was larger than before, it seemed difficult to avoid it by fluke.<br>
This time we have to hit with all our might.<br>
—Youngest.<br>
'Yes.'<br>
The moment my heart beat loudly, the dragon's heart carried rough magical energy throughout my body.<br>
As I felt pain due to torn blood vessels, pages started turning in my head.<br>
[The exclusive skill 'Bookmark' is activated!]<br>
We are Kim Dokja.<br>
Reader fight in their own way.<br>
—The person we need right now.<br>
'It's a monster that can take on seven great-grade constellations.'<br>
—It’s hard to do just that. The physical size doesn't match, so the cost of class is too high.<br>
'It won't work even with a broken sword.'<br>
A character who can defeat seven great constellations.<br>
There were many people that came to mind, but it was hard to think of anyone who could take them down without unduly harming the balance of the scales.<br>
—There is one.<br>
But will it work? That person is a 'constellation'.<br>
Originally, [Bookmark] only works on 'characters'.<br>
In fact, in the Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Kim Dokja never once borrowed the power of 'constellations' as a bookmark.<br>
—Maybe, because I happened to get the 'Dragon Heart' too.<br>
But it wasn't impossible.<br>
There was definitely an increase in understanding of bookmarks for 'constellations'.<br>
'Then let's do it.'<br>
An existence that is at the limit that my current body can handle and that the probability of the scale allows.<br>
「"This guy was born to be a businessman."」<br>
As the pages stopped turning, his history filled my ears.<br>
「"I was born with the blood of a dragon."」<br>
In the main story, there was no opportunity to borrow his power as a 'bookmark'.<br>
This is because there was insufficient understanding.<br>
[You possess the 'Dragon Heart'.]<br>
[Your body specifications are similar to the person's body specifications.]<br>
But what about now?<br>
[Bookmark number 21 is activated.]<br>
My heart was pounding loudly and my vision was distorted.<br>
The rushing constellations shouted as if they were struggling.<br>
[I don’t know what you’re trying to do—]<br>
[Kill him! At best, he can only use the power of a great-grade!]<br>
At best, he is a great-grade.<br>
However, even great-grade have a hierarchy.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Three Swords Lv. ???' is activated!]<br>
He is the most powerful constellation.<br>
He is a being who has never swung his sword at the same opponent more than three times in his life.<br>
A warrior who cut down a thousand people with one sword, collapsed a mountain with two swords, and split the sea with three swords.<br>
[Bookmark number 21 'Goryeo First Sword Cheok Jungyeong' is activated!]<br>
The constellation at the rear, who belatedly realized something, shouted.<br>
[Wait, stop! Valkyrie's daughter! Something is wrong! Now he is—]<br>
Before he could even finish his words, the entire landscape in front of him was torn apart.

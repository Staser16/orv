710 Episode 26 Star Ladder (6)<br>
Cheok Jungyeong's first Japanese meal that serves a thousand people at once.<br>
Ilgeomchamcheon.<br>
I was familiar with its grandeur and performance. Because I wrote that sentence with my own hands.<br>
When was it? Was it when Kim Dokja, who was imprisoned in [Hundred Days of Seal], borrowed 'Ganpyeongui' and summoned Cheok Jungyeong?<br>
「A swordsmanship cultivated over a lifetime by a great genius who may only appear once every tens of thousands of years. The most ideal cut created solely for destruction.」<br>
But now that I look at it, I feel like I need to change that sentence a bit.<br>
Why didn't I write down that it hurts to use it?<br>
No. Did I write it down? If it was written, it was insufficient.<br>
It felt like someone had bent all my joints in a way that made them impossible to move. Even though [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] was activated, the pain was felt right down to my soul.<br>
Looking at my tattered right hand, I wondered how on earth Kim Dokja could endure something like this.<br>
—This is barely a sword, youngest.<br>
It's barely like this.<br>
So, just what level of destructive power are Cheok Jungyeong's three swords and the four swords created after that?<br>
—That Cheok Jungyeong was also blocked at 'great-grade'. The guys you have to deal with in the future are higher than that.<br>
I can't even guess.<br>
What kind of story must we build to reach that place? Is it really possible to reach it?<br>
How was it possible for Kim Dokja not to be scared even when facing that high sky?<br>
—You can do it. Because we already did it once.<br>
The thick dust cleared and there was only one constellation left where the blade passed.<br>
[How...]<br>
The six brilliantly shining stars of <Asgard> have set.<br>
There is only one thing left. Only 'Valkyrie's Daughter' remained. Even then, more than half of her incarnation body was blown away.<br>
As her spear, which had been resting on the floor, scattered into powder, Valkyrie's Daughter fell to the ground.<br>
[This technique is definitely that monster's...]<br>
The trembling woman also seemed to recognize Cheok Jungyeong's sword.<br>
Cheok Jungyeong, like Kim Dokja, was cursed with [Fate] and became an enemy of the giant nebula, so it was no surprise that Valkyrie's Daughter recognized this technique.<br>
Afterwards, Valkyrie's Daughter, whose magic power flowed back, began to vomit.<br>
[Oh, no. It can't end like this—]<br>
And.<br>
['Ginnungagap' ends.]<br>
I felt the curtain surrounding me disappear. The curtain of 'Ginnungagap' staged in <Asgard> is finally about to disappear.<br>
[The effect of 'Ginnungagap' is activated.]<br>
[What happened in 'Ginnungagap' is not recorded in the world line.]<br>
The curtain disappeared, revealing the ruined city of Washington. The incarnations nearby looked at each other blankly.<br>
Valkyrie's Daughter, who had not yet been lifted from 'half-body advent', also looked embarrassed.<br>
[How on earth did this happen...]<br>
The reason that 'half-body advent' was not lifted is probably because the power of 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' was damaged.<br>
What was puzzling was her reaction.<br>
[Wh-where has everyone gone! Constellations, what's going on! Why me—]<br>
Valkyrie's daughter, who had been spouting off a bunch of stories, croaked. It seems as if she had forgotten all previous events.<br>
She wasn't the only one having this strange reaction.<br>
"Cheon Inho?"<br>
Anna Croft, who had been watching the battle by my side, was asking with a confused look on her face.<br>
"What on earth happened? Why is Valkyrie’s daughter…? No, these traces…"<br>
With those words, Anna activated [Past Tense]. But all that came back was a light spark.<br>
Afterwards, it was felt that the incarnations of the area were shaking in confusion.<br>
"What happened to the Black Beast?"<br>
"What? Why am I here…"<br>
"The black beast has fallen!"<br>
"It’s a constellation! A constellation has descended!"<br>
"I feel like my head is going to explode."<br>
What happened inside 'Ginnungagap' is not recorded. However, this 'record' apparently also included the 'memories' of humans and constellations.<br>
Anna Croft, who had been staring blankly into space, came to her senses and muttered.<br>
"No way... 'Ginnungagap'?"<br>
She was also a prophet. Did she realize what had happened in that short period of time?<br>
Anyway, it was disappointing.<br>
The fact that everything that happened in 'Ginnungagap' was not recorded also meant that the things that happened there could not be made into stories.<br>
It was unfair that the incident of executing as many as ten 'great-grade constellations' was not recognized as a story, but somehow they survived.<br>
But when I thought about it, something felt strange.<br>
「I remember all the incidents that happened in 'Ginnungagap'.」<br>
Along with the feeling of my heart becoming cold, I felt the power of the story surrounding Kim Dokja and me.<br>
[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' is in effect.]<br>
[You are not affected by the record erasure effect of 'Ginnungagap'.]<br>
[The constellations of the nebula <Asgard> are greatly embarrassed.]<br>
[The nebula <Asgard> protests to the Bureau.]<br>
.<br>
.<br>
[Your record will be sent to the <Star Stream>.]<br>
[Your achievements have been recorded in the <Star Stream>.]<br>
[You have achieved an achievement that does not exist!]<br>
[The <Star Stream> reviews your achievements.]<br>
Since when did it start? 'Valkyrie’s Daughter’s' expression was grotesquely distorted as she looked at me.<br>
[Nonsense—How to do 'Ginnungagap'?]<br>
She also realized what was happening.<br>
She urgently looked up at the sky and burst out with her loud mantra.<br>
[Stop it! Constellations! We must kill him quickly! Right now!]<br>
Sparks of probability were swirling around 'Valkyrie’s Daughter'.<br>
[He remembers everything that happened inside 'Ginnungagap'!]<br>
What it meant was clear.<br>
I don't know why, but the incident we committed was recorded as a 'story'.<br>
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' requests to view the records.]<br>
[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' requests to view the records.]<br>
[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' requests access to the records.]<br>
[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' requests to view the records.]<br>
[The constellation 'Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake' requests to view the records.]<br>
…<br>
Endless indirect messages.<br>
[The Management Bureau is reviewing your 'new story'!]<br>
I said, suppressing my overflowing heart.<br>
'Constellation-nim.'<br>
If this incident is recognized as a 'story', I will get a story about the massacre of 'ten great-grade constellations' in the seventh scenario.<br>
An impossible story told on a stage where recording is impossible.<br>
An achievement that not even Kim Dokja in the main story could achieve.<br>
I couldn't even guess what kind of story I was going to receive.<br>
However, Kim Dokja—that is, the 'Demon King of Salvation'—looked strangely reluctant.<br>
—This is not good.<br>
'It's not good?'<br>
—Youngest, do you remember that I was given [fate]?<br>
Of course I remember.<br>
Because of the [fate] he received at that time, Kim Dokja died several times and was even expelled from the scenario in the tenth scenario.<br>
—That was the 'eight scenario'. But if this happens in only the seventh scenario, what do you think the giant nebulae will look like?<br>
'Ah...'<br>
—Shit. I thought it would be okay because it was 'Ginnungagap'.<br>
I remembered what the 'giant nebulae' were.<br>
In this <Star Stream>, these guys are more serious about the fight for food than anyone else. They were the ones who called on [Fate] to stop Kim Dokja.<br>
There's no way those guys would just sit by and watch us, who defeated ten 'great-grade constellations'.<br>
The intervals between thunder sounds, as if representing our anxiety, were becoming shorter and shorter.<br>
I asked, swallowing my ominousness.<br>
'Are they going to deploy additional constellations?'<br>
<Asgard> would have suffered enormous losses just by bringing in 'Ginnungagap'.<br>
I wanted to believe that no matter how large the nebula was, it would be difficult to sustain any further damage.<br>
—It would be nice if not...<br>
['Bookmark' is released.]<br>
['Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is temporarily disabled.]<br>
With a tremendous recoil, my vision darkened as if a fuse had blown, but slowly recovered.<br>
Anna Croft helped me as I stumbled.<br>
"Cheon Inho? Are you okay? Cheon Inho!"<br>
I nodded at her and stood upright with her support.<br>
"What is this, what happened in 'Ginnungagap'?"<br>
"I’ll explain later, but for now, Yoo Jonghyuk—"<br>
The moment I said that, light sparks flew throughout my body and my vitality returned, albeit slightly.<br>
['Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated again!]<br>
—Additional probability was paid.<br>
Additional probability?<br>
—Something seems wrong. Be careful, youngest.<br>
This 'scenario' is a scenario that balances the scales instead of causing repercussions.<br>
The fact that extra probability arose on this side meant that someone other than us was using that much probability on the other side of the scale.<br>
What appeared beyond the portal were incarnations in exotic costumes. Judging by the atmosphere they gave off, they seemed to be from the Balkan Peninsula or the Mediterranean.<br>
Anna Croft, who discovered them, greeted them first.<br>
"Are they the Greeks incarnation?"<br>
One of the group nodded.<br>
"The scenario is already over. You can go back."<br>
It was just as Anna Croft said.<br>
[The current sub-scenario has ended.]<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, who became the black beast, has fallen, and the reward for the 'sub-scenario' is out.<br>
It became Kim Dokja’s responsibility.<br>
But now additional personnel have been dispatched?<br>
It was a bad situation no matter who looked at it. In fact, instead of responding to Anna Croft's words, the guys quickly looked around.<br>
"As expected, <Asgard> came first."<br>
The man who found the fallen 'Valkyrie's Daughter' muttered, and the incarnations nearby helped.<br>
"You bastards. Did you really use 'Ginnungagap'?"<br>
"You paid that price just to deal with one incarnation?"<br>
'Valkyrie’s Daughter' growled, her eyes wide.<br>
[You guys. Who are you?]<br>
The angry mantra uttered by 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' caused an uproar throughout the area.<br>
However, despite the constellation's attack, the incarnations seemed completely unfazed.<br>
"It’s pathetic. Even after using 'Ginnungagap', you failed."<br>
Clearly they were incarnations. However, no matter how you look at their tone, it was not like incarnations.<br>
The enraged 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' spewed out her mantra once again.<br>
[This is the area of <Asgard>! I don’t know who you guys are, but—]<br>
The words of 'Valkyrie’s Daughter' could not continue. Because her head had already been cut off and sent flying away.<br>
The Greek man who brushed off his bloody shamshir grinned, held her severed head and shook it.<br>
"Good things must be shared, friend."<br>
No matter how much strength is exhausted, it is a power that can cut down a constellation that has 'half-strengthened' in one blow.<br>
[The constellation 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' grins.]<br>
Thebes? Damn it. o way.<br>
—I know what kind of guys they are.<br>
[The constellations of <Olympus> are looking at you.]<br>
After <Asgard>, it's <Olympus>.<br>
'I think they came looking for fragments too.'<br>
—I guess there was a rumor that we were a good restaurant.<br>
The incarnations that appeared were all incarnations of <Olympus>.<br>
Looking at the flow of probability flowing around, it seems that the constellations of Olympus are controlling the incarnations by raising the synchronization rate to the limit.<br>
Kim Dokja borrowed my mouth and said something.<br>
"You guys seem to be misunderstanding something, but this isn’t 'Holy Demon War' or 'Gigantomachia'."<br>
Even if it is a scenario where the 'scale of probability' works, there is a degree.<br>
If the weight that the scale cannot support rises, the scale will eventually break and the scenario will end in catastrophe.<br>
"Are you all here just to be burned to death by lightning? No matter how absurd the odds are—"<br>
As if to prove Kim Dokja's words, lightning flashed in the air.<br>
However, a new portal was opening in the place where the lightning flashed.<br>
There wasn't only one.<br>
Incarnations wearing various costumes were popping out one after another from dozens of portals that opened simultaneously.<br>
[The constellations of the nebula <Ghost> are looking at you.]<br>
<Ghost>.<br>
[The constellations of the nebula <Tree of Protection> are looking at you.]<br>
<Tree of Protection>.<br>
[The constellations of the nebula <Veda> are looking at you.]<br>
...<Veda>.<br>
When I checked there, I heard Kim Dokja's voice.<br>
—Youngest.<br>
'Yes.'<br>
We began to run away, carrying the fallen Yoo Jonghyuk on our backs.

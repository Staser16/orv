714 Episode 26 Star Ladder (10)<br>
As my vision narrowed, I realized what was about to happen.<br>
「The Demon King of Salvation wants to sacrifice himself.」<br>
The situation is desperate. The Washington Dome was under siege by great-grade constellations, and there was no constellation to help us.<br>
To make matters worse, he was sentenced by [fate].<br>
Kim Dokja made a decision in a situation where death was inevitable no matter what he did.<br>
Only through his death can this obstacle be overcome.<br>
'Stop!<br>
But I couldn't leave it like that.<br>
This is my [fate]. It's my share to bear.<br>
'Stop!'<br>
There is no reason why the Demon King of Salvation should receive it instead.<br>
'Kim Dokja!'<br>
—You're not ready to fight them yet.<br>
I felt like someone was supporting me.<br>
I turned my head and saw Christina Page.<br>
Just as I was about to say thank you, my eyes met hers with a faint hint of guilt. Her fingers moved with an ominous foreboding.<br>
My vision went dark.<br>
*<br>
Christina Page.<br>
Anna Croft's closest associate who leads 'Zarathustra'.<br>
She is an FBI forensic hypnosis expert and is called 'Finger Snapper' in 'Ways of Survival'.<br>
Just before she possessed this character, Olivia was playing TRPG with her friends.<br>
'Kevin, Jim, Amelia.'<br>
Olivia thought about her own friends.<br>
She had friends who liked subculture.<br>
Kevin only read webtoons with 'SSS' in the title.<br>
Jim loved martial arts novels.<br>
Amelia loved virtual idols.<br>
'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' was a Korean web novel brought by Kevin.<br>
—Guys, how are we supposed to survive once we enter this novel?<br>
—Oh, Kevin. It's starting again.<br>
—This is set in Korea. I think we'll be at a bit of a disadvantage.<br>
—No, America is also included.<br>
—Kevin, but the title of this novel doesn’t include 'SSS'?<br>
ㅡ As you read, SSS appears. Olivia, can you write an email to the author? You said before that you have a Korean friend. Let's add this novel's world view in the next session.<br>
What would it have been like if she hadn't listened to Kevin at that time?<br>
If she hadn't sent the email to the author, all of this wouldn't have happened.<br>
'Oh my God.'<br>
It was sheer luck that she survived.<br>
It turns out that the person who she possessed was 'Christina Page'.<br>
She has always enjoyed playing TRPGs, so it wasn't difficult for her to play the role of 'Christina Page'. She was glad the task wasn't difficult.<br>
Olivia was able to forget who she was, at least while she was playing 'Christina Page'.<br>
—Demon King of Salvation.<br>
She could forget Kevin, forget herself, forget Amelia, forget her dead friends.<br>
—Can you really save my friends?<br>
A message from the 'Demon King of Salvation' delivered through the exclusive skill, [Nightmare].<br>
—Yes.<br>
The Demon King of Salvation said.<br>
If she grants his request, he will definitely save her dead friends.<br>
And the request is—<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Daily Invoice Lv.5' is activated!]<br>
Christina hurriedly helped Cheon Inho, who fell in front of her.<br>
She was startled to see Anna Croft stumbling in the distance.<br>
"Christina! What are you doing?"<br>
"It is the order of the Demon King of Salvation."<br>
"Yes?"<br>
"He told me to place a [Daily Invoice] on his incarnation."<br>
"What the hell is that—"<br>
She doesn't know why the Demon King of Salvation made such a request.<br>
"It doesn’t matter. This person can ignore my [daily invoice] and move his incarnation."<br>
She doesn't know, but she thought they were planning to use [Daily Invoice] to fight.<br>
The strange thing is why he communicated directly through [Nightmare] rather than using his incarnation.<br>
"Then why doesn’t Cheon Inho wake up? Last time he woke up right away."<br>
"I know that too—"<br>
It was then that a bright beam of light burst from the Capitol.<br>
This was the area where the 'sub-scenario' occurred earlier.<br>
The place where the fake 'Demon King of Salvation' and the ‘black beast’ appeared.<br>
However, the false Demon King of Salvation was defeated, and Yoo Jonghyuk, who became the Black Beast, also fainted.<br>
The scenario has already ended.<br>
But why are sparks flying around the Capitol?<br>
"Christina. The cost is incorrect."<br>
Dark clouds filled the sky and covered the Capitol.<br>
A pitch-black thunderbolt falling between dark clouds.<br>
[The 'Demon King of Salvation' is resurrected in the scenario.]<br>
The demon king, who was thought to be dead, appeared in Washington.<br>
*<br>
The 'Dark Keeper', hugged in the warm abyss, thought.<br>
「I.」<br>
A question that has been asked for a very long time.<br>
「Who am I?」<br>
That moon gate was all that explained him. The answer he couldn't get even though he gave up all his resources.<br>
In order to find it, the 'Dark Keeper' contracted with the dokkaebi and became part of the scenario.<br>
Nevertheless,<br>
「I was not the Demon King of Salvation.」<br>
He couldn't find the answer he wanted.<br>
There couldn't be an exact answer.<br>
The stars turned away from him and the script abandoned him.<br>
He is just a nameless character.<br>
Or a monster that didn't even become a character. A consumable to make the main character shine.<br>
「That’s fine.」<br>
He already knew that this world was a playground for constellations. Even if it was just a sand castle that was built for a short time on the playground and then collapsed, he wanted to have his own name.<br>
He wanted to be a proper part of the playground.<br>
He wanted to become the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
—Do you really want to become the 'Demon King of Salvation'?<br>
The 'Dark Keeper' looked up blankly at the Demon King of Salvation.<br>
—Whatever the cost?<br>
He wants to have a name.<br>
He wants to have a proper role and die after fulfilling it.<br>
The 'Dark Keeper' nodded with all his might.<br>
He's good even if it's just one sentence, so if there's a story given to him.<br>
—Then let’s give it a try.<br>
He wants to write down that story.<br>
[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' begins its storytelling.]<br>
The cold snow covered him.<br>
「I.」<br>
The dark sentinel soon became one with distant eternity.<br>
「We are the Demon King of salvation.」<br>
His tattered body was once again filled with probability and filled with the story of the constellation.<br>
Tsutsutsutsu!<br>
In the midst of wild sparks, Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation', opened his eyes.<br>
When he lightly tilted his head, his body screamed along with a crunching sound.<br>
A demonic body full of traces of being cut to pieces by Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
Even though no limb was intact, it was important that the plan was successful.<br>
[The constellations of <Asgard> are astonished!]<br>
A plan that was dramatically successful.<br>
This could not have been realized if several probabilities had not been interlocked like cogs.<br>
A giant nebula uttered [fate].<br>
That [fate] was given to him, a narrative-grade constellation, instead of an incarnation.<br>
The probability ran wild due to a calculation error in the twisted [fate].<br>
Under the pretext of extra probability, he was given the right to move to a new body.<br>
Above all, the plan could not have succeeded if it had not been for the help of the demon 'Dark Keeper' who impersonated the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
[The incarnation body is quiet with your story.]<br>
[The synchronization rate between you and the incarnation body increases.]<br>
Perhaps this will be his last story.<br>
"It’s him! He’s over there!"<br>
The incarnations who sensed his status began to flock to him.<br>
The great constellations belonging to the giant nebula that were chasing Lee Hakhyun just a moment ago.<br>
"W-what is that—"<br>
"Why in a body other than your own incarnation..."<br>
"Could it be that you were trying to protect the incarnation?"<br>
The constellations looked at each other in disbelief.<br>
Someone said with a sly smile.<br>
"They say he’s a fragment of a discarded god, but he’s incredibly stupid."<br>
Stupid.<br>
That was correct.<br>
[The constellations of the nebula <Ghost> shake their heads at your foolishness.]<br>
[The constellations of the nebula <Guardian Tree> are saddened by your choice.]<br>
[The constellations of the nebula <Olympus> laugh at your judgment.]<br>
The body of the resurrected demon species creaked. The word was resurrection, but the body was already dead. An incarnation that can't last even 10 minutes at best.<br>
From afar, the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' shouted loudly.<br>
"You've finally been caught, Demon King of Salvation! There's nowhere to run now!"<br>
As if victory had already been achieved, the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' walked towards him with great strides and spoke in a triumphant voice.<br>
"You have no idea how much effort I put into catching you. I persuaded the nebulae one by one…"<br>
Now that [fate] has been declared, it will be difficult to avoid death.<br>
The situation might have been a little better if there had been a story like 'I, the Opponent of Fate', and Cheok Junyung’s 'The One Who Fights Against Fate', which the 1,865th round of <Kim Dokja Company> had.<br>
But there was no such story.<br>
There were many stories that he does not have today.<br>
「Maybe the youngest will find everything.」<br>
The youngest was a strange guy.<br>
Among the 'Kim Dokjas' he knows, he is the only one who can write.<br>
He was curious at first.<br>
He was curious about what the guy who possessed this petty villain would talk about.<br>
The guy who clumsily imitated 'Kim Dokja' was cute, and he was a little proud of the guy who took care of the things that 'Kim Dokja' didn’t do.<br>
Sometimes he was so frustrated that he wanted to say something.<br>
Still, it was fun to see the story of such a guy.<br>
「But he’s the youngest.」<br>
Maybe that's why he's here now.<br>
「This damned world won’t read the story you wrote.」<br>
The 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', who had been talking for a while, frowned.<br>
"…So, are you listening to my story?"<br>
The Demon King of Salvation looked at him for a moment and laughed.<br>
Among the tales of the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', there was the 'final cubic crystal'.<br>
A tale that makes one confess one's desires at the last moment in exchange for raising one's status.<br>
"Uh, go ahead."<br>
While the 'Gatekeeper of Thebes' was talking, the Demon King of Salvation looked through the coat the demon servant was wearing.<br>
There was a cigarette pack in the coat.<br>
As he took out a cigarette, the idea of a guy who liked cigarettes came to mind.<br>
Who was it?<br>
Memories dispersed like smoke. The place where the memories disappeared hurt. That pain immediately proved that he was Kim Dokja.<br>
The 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', who came to his senses belatedly, blushed and shouted.<br>
"Kill him! Retrieve the fragment!"<br>
Incarnations rushing towards him.<br>
The Demon King of Salvation said, tossing away his cigarette.<br>
"Youngest, let me borrow some weapons."<br>
Silver light flew from somewhere and settled in the right hand of the Demon King of Salvation.<br>
[The tale 'The One Who is Loved by All Things' begins its storytelling.]<br>
[The item 'Thoughts of Almost Everything' is suitable for your story.]<br>
In a flash of bright light, one of the incarnations that was running at the front was split in half.<br>
"Kaaaaaaak!"<br>
'Thoughts' mimicked 'Broken Faith'.<br>
'I activate 'Blade of Faith'.<br>
"How can you still—"<br>
The constellations retreated in awe.<br>
The power to kill the incarnation of a great constellation with increased synchronization.<br>
The 'Gatekeeper of Thebes', with his eyes wide open as if torn apart, screamed loudly.<br>
"It’s just a fluke! Keep pushing! Even he’s at his limit!"<br>
The hesitating constellations rushed forward again.<br>
The Demon King of Salvation swung his sword without hesitation. Cut off their arms, cut off their legs, and slit their throat.<br>
Every time that happened, the wounds on the demon species' body also increased.<br>
「This world is an obvious tragedy.」<br>
He pulled out the arrow stuck in his shoulder and kicked away the spear that grazed his thigh.<br>
「A world created to cause pain to Yoo Jonghyuk.」<br>
The moment he removed the blade aimed at his side, a pain arose in his back. The torn wings of the demon species fluttered across the floor.<br>
「A story marred by big and small failures and never-ending despair. This world was the fate given to Yoo Jonghyuk.」<br>
The moment the torn wing fell to the ground, lightning struck again from the sky.<br>
「Therefore, anyone who tries to share that responsibility will surely be cursed.」<br>
The void curtain fluttered and another star fell into the white shining night sky.<br>
[Some great fate is wishing for your death.]<br>
He is the Demon King of Salvation who cannot feel emotions.<br>
Nevertheless, at this moment, he was also Kim Dokja. Maybe it was because I met the youngest.<br>
"Okay. Are you fighting too?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk couldn’t answer.<br>
Just as the writing on the monitor does not respond.<br>
Some communication never happens. And where communication is impossible, there is just a story.<br>
「The Demon King of Salvation lives to read that story.」<br>
The Demon King of Salvation smiled like a prisoner accepting a deserved punishment.

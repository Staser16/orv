717 Episode 26 Star Ladder (13)<br>
Bullets flew from somewhere and rained down on his head. The cargo's surprise commission accomplishments evacuated the incarnation.<br>
"What kind of guy—!"<br>
At the same time, shells more than twice the amount of charge poured out. It was not ordinary bullets.<br>
Each magical bullet was filled with concentrated magical energy.<br>
As several incarnations fell after being attacked, the enraged constellations looked in the direction where the fire started.<br>
"Those scum-like incarnations—"<br>
The incarnations dressed as refugees continued shooting.<br>
"Keep shooting."<br>
There was a man standing in the center of the refugees.<br>
Jacob Martinez.<br>
Las Vegas’s 'King of the North'.<br>
The great-grade constellations, running at remarkable speed, quickly broke through the ranks of refugees and rushed at Martinez.<br>
The moment Martinez opened his eyes, the great-grade constellations in each direction cut off Martinez's arms and torso.<br>
"Hahaha! You idiot!"<br>
The severed limbs along with the blood flowed through the air.<br>
[The character 'Jacob Martinez' activates 'Cutting Magic Lv.7'!]<br>
Martinez, who quickly put the cut off limbs back together, looked toward the back and spoke.<br>
"We can’t take too long. The opponent is <Olympus>."<br>
"I know."<br>
"Go. With this, the North has paid its debt."<br>
The woman nodded her head and hugged the fallen Demon King of Salvation. Her body trembled as he entered the process of extinction.<br>
"Don’t move."<br>
The Demon King of Salvation looked up at the woman. An off-white color that shines brightly even on the battlefield.<br>
It wasn't the face he remembered.<br>
"I thought it was Yoo Sangah."<br>
Ji Eunyu laughed heartily.<br>
"I am her incarnation."<br>
The incarnation of Yoo Sangah. Maybe that's why the atmosphere strangely resembles Yoo Sangah.<br>
"It’s dangerous out here. If you’re here to save the youngest, you’re in the wrong place. The youngest is over there—"<br>
"They’re still negotiating with the 'recycling center'."<br>
Are the negotiations still not over?<br>
Then the situation was not good.<br>
A situation where <Olympus> resurrected Ares by  a giant . If he doesn’t send the youngest up quickly—<br>
"Is that all you have to say?"<br>
Ji Eunyu said as she ran while holding the Demon King of Salvation in her arms.<br>
"There’s something I need to say first."<br>
An incarnation that resembles Yoo Sangah not only in her mood but also in her tone of voice.<br>
Ji Eunyu continued her words with a light sigh.<br>
"I was asked to keep an eye on you because you might still do something like this."<br>
"..."<br>
"She wanted to use the Golden Headband, but she also asked me to tell you that it’s a pity that she couldn’t do that."<br>
Golden Headband.<br>
The Demon King of Salvation opened his mouth without realizing it.<br>
"I am not the Kim Dokja that Yoo Sangah is looking for."<br>
As he said those words, the Demon King of Salvation thought of the third child. The third child had the main memory related to the 'Headband'.<br>
"As if that person isn’t Yoo Sangah."<br>
In the rapidly rushing scenery, the Demon King of Salvation felt his stories dispersing.<br>
[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' continues with a stutter.]<br>
Ji Eunyu's hand wrapped around him and held on to the scattered stories.<br>
"You are the Kim Dokja she is looking for."<br>
It was a very warm hand.<br>
"I’ve read more stories about you than anyone else, so I guarantee you."<br>
Is it because the woman telling that story really looked like Yoo Sangah?<br>
The Demon King of Salvation slowly opened his mouth.<br>
"How is Yoo Sangah?"<br>
"Are you okay?"<br>
"Tell her I’m sorry."<br>
"Please tell her directly."<br>
"You say you are the incarnation of Yoo Sangah."<br>
"You heard I’m not Yoo Sangah."<br>
"For now, let’s assume you’re Yoo Sangah. So—"<br>
The Demon King of Salvation knew.<br>
Yoo Sangah cannot come here.<br>
He doesn't know if it's because of the 'scale of probability' or the restrictions of the 'Void Veil', but at least she won't be able to come until he dies.<br>
Perhaps his words will not be conveyed properly to Yoo Sangah.<br>
"Thank you so much, Yoo Sangah."<br>
But at least it will remain as a story.<br>
And one day, Yoo Sangah will read his story left on this wall.<br>
The Demon King of Salvation was satisfied with that.<br>
"Really, thank you."<br>
His scenario is now over.<br>
Now the protagonist and characters of this story have changed.<br>
"I don’t know what you’re thankful for ."<br>
Nonetheless, the story continues.<br>
"I’m going to ask, so make sure you’re alive until then."<br>
Is it because there is still a story left unfinished?<br>
The Demon King of Salvation slowly blinked his eyes and asked.<br>
"Is that what Yoo Sangah just said?"<br>
"That’s just what I said?"<br>
"You are just the incarnation of Yoo Sangah."<br>
"I just decided to be Yoo Sangah."<br>
Ji Eunyu said, kicking the ground with all her might and running.<br>
"I don’t know, but Yoo Sangah would definitely have said that."<br>
The explosion sound coming from behind was gradually fading away.<br>
The northern king's troops were annihilated.<br>
"I heard about you from my youngest."<br>
Editor Ji Eunyu.<br>
In his youngest's memory, she was quite an important figure.<br>
She was the first to read and edit the stories the youngest wrote. Perhaps, without her, his 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' written by his youngest would not have been possible.<br>
「"Writer, look. Kim Dokja’s lines here are a bit strange."<br>
"I think this line suits him."<br>
"No! Look, he wasn’t a character who spoke like this before—"<br>
"Isn’t that the character’s three-dimensionality?"<br>
"This is not three-dimensional, it’s a kabung."」<br>
A thought suddenly occurred to him.<br>
If he and Yoo Sangah had been reincarnated in a different world, wouldn't they have been like that?<br>
「Doesn’t Kim Dokja want to be someone else sometimes?」<br>
A world without scenarios and constellations. A world where all these tragedies are just imagination in the lines of text.<br>
The youngest came from that world.<br>
"You stayed here to save the youngest?"<br>
Ji Eunyu did not answer.<br>
"You’re like the youngest Yoo Sangah."<br>
"I’m not Yoo Sangah. Stop talking. The story will be scattered."<br>
"I’m going to die anyway. There’s less than a minute left."<br>
Ji Eunyu’s steps stopped.<br>
The great-grade constellations hidden in the front line appeared one by one. Additional great-grade constellations dispatched from <Olympus> appeared accompanied by their incarnations.<br>
"Turn off [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint] and run away! That’s it."<br>
"No. I’ve put restrictions on it."<br>
It is different from the general [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint].<br>
The Demon King of Salvation risked his own life to kill the incarnations of great-grade and kill the incarnation of Ares, a narrative-grade constellation.<br>
"This [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint] cannot be canceled on its own."<br>
In other words, when this incarnation body disappears, it also disappears.<br>
"What on earth were you thinking? You’re the one they’re after."<br>
"I know."<br>
"Then why—"<br>
Why did he do such an unreasonable thing?<br>
The Demon King of Salvation doesn't know much either.<br>
He may have believed that his stage was not over yet.<br>
He may have wanted to recreate the days when he was hunting down constellations as the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
When saw the story of the youngest fighting desperately alone, his blood boiled without him knowing, and he may have wanted to prove that he, too, was a 'Kim Dokja'.<br>
The 'Thoughts' borrowed from the youngest hummed and cried.<br>
"The Demon King of Salvation I know never dies."<br>
"..."<br>
"You know that he is a person who survives no matter what he does, right?"<br>
Great-grade constellations approached from all directions.<br>
There was no place to run now.<br>
There wa no way for them to escape unless the 'star ladder' came down.<br>
But what star would dare to lower the 'star ladder' against the 'giant nebula'?<br>
"So please save him."<br>
As Ji Eunyu said those words, her gaze rested on Cheon Inho in the distance for a moment.<br>
"Please, save Kim Dokja."<br>
The Demon King of Salvation listened to those words blankly. Perhaps he came all the way here because he wanted to hear those words.<br>
[The story 'Demon King of Salvation' wants to continue its storytelling.]<br>
The Demon King of Salvation, who stumbled out of Ji Eunyu's arms, spoke.<br>
"Okay."<br>
Beyond the incarnations of great-grade constellations that surrounded them, a man with a fearsome appearance was walking.<br>
"Demon—King—of—Salvation"<br>
It was the resurrected incarnation of Ares.<br>
Tsutsutsu!<br>
Ares walked forward, enduring aftereffects that exceed the probability limit.<br>
Even if all his remaining stories exploded, it was impossible to defeat him.<br>
Thunder struck once again across the night sky. The Demon King of Salvation thought of Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
Perhaps Yoo Jonghyuk or Kim Dokja Company will not be able to come. Because the giant nebulae will be blocking them by sacrificing their giant stories.<br>
Not only the, but no one else in this world can intervene in this scenario where the giant nebulae run rampant.<br>
「Except for only one place.」<br>
The Demon King of Salvation raised his head.<br>
"Are you there?"<br>
They are the group that controls this 'world' itself.<br>
Those who control the scenario in the torrent of the <Star Stream> and guide the world to the ◼️◼️ of everything.<br>
"Bihyung."<br>
Sparks struck in the air at the call of the Demon King of Salvation. And,<br>
—Are you serious?<br>
Bihyung, a dokkaebi belonging to the 'Management Bureau' responded.<br>
"Yes."<br>
The Demon King of Salvation knew. Bihyung is probably not the only one listening to him now.<br>
The great dokkaebis of this world line—perhaps the dokkaebi king beyond—are also listening to his story.<br>
And what he's going to say, he's already guessing.<br>
—The price will be very high.<br>
He knows. Perhaps it would be more cruel than death.<br>
"It does not matter."<br>
Nevertheless, he has to meet his youngest again.<br>
When they meet, he has to tell him what he  told him yet.<br>
What kind of person is the 'real Kim Dokja'?<br>
Where is Han Sooyoung, whom he was searching for?<br>
How can readers from other world lines be sent back?<br>
Who is the guy who killed us?<br>
And—<br>
「Why does this 'world' exist?」<br>
The constellations noticed something unusual and rushed towards this direction.<br>
"That bastard! Stop him—!"<br>
Looking at them, the Demon King of Salvation grinned.<br>
「You will get nothing.」<br>
The Demon King of Salvation declared.<br>
"I will dedicate myself to the <Star Stream>."<br>
Then the world responded to his words.<br>
[The <Star Stream> accepts your offer.]<br>
[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' is consecrated to the 'Star Stream'.]<br>
"Stop! You bastard!"<br>
The fact that the constellation sealed itself in the 'Star Stream' was tantamount to voluntarily becoming the subject of a scenario.<br>
[The mayor of 'Jeonsang City' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]<br>
[The host of 'Ragnarok' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]<br>
[The 'Fallen ruins' owner wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]<br>
[The creator of the 'Holy Demon War' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]<br>
…<br>
[The director of the 'Recycling Center' wants to incorporate the 'Demon King of Salvation' into his scenario.]<br>
He didn't know how he  be used in which scenario. But now he had offered himself and was entitled to ask for it in return.<br>
"I accept the granting authority of the 'Star Ladder'."<br>
[The 'Administrative Bureau' approves your payment.]<br>
Ares arrived right in front of the Demon King of Salvation and swung his spear.<br>
In a split second, a dazzling beam of light appeared and the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation' disappeared.<br>
"No!"<br>
At the same time, a bright ladder began to come down from thin air.<br>
「Star Ladder.」<br>
An opportunity to ascend to heaven given to several incarnations in exchange for the constellation 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
Anna Croft and Selena Kim climbed the ladder to help Cheon Inho and Yoo Jonghyuk, who had fallen, and Ji Eunyu also held onto the ladder with Martinez.<br>
The ladder carrying all the scheduled incarnations began to ascend to the sky.<br>
Coo coo coo coo!<br>
Ares was furious and went berserk.<br>
"I can’t admit it!"<br>
Ares's angry body stretched out his hand toward the star ladder.<br>
"Stop it! Stop his incarnation from using the star ladder! Just make him drop it somehow!"<br>
Great-grade constellations, including the gatekeeper of Thebes, belatedly attacked the ladder.<br>
However, a translucent curtain created sparks and blocked their intervention.<br>
"How dare you—"<br>
At that moment, Ares felt like the scales of the scenario were balanced.<br>
It was impossible.<br>
If there is a being who can achieve equilibrium with a narrative-grade constellation—<br>
[Stop, Ares.]<br>
All the constellations, including Ares, stopped along with their incarnations at the mantra filled with tremendous power.<br>
Ares lifted his head and looked up at the sky in disbelief.<br>
At the end of the star ladder leading to the 'recycling center' were beings with pure white wings spread out.<br>
Unlike <Olympus> and <Asgard>, which participated in the scenario, these stars were the only ones among the three giant nebulae that remained silent.<br>
"Eden!"<br>
[The constellation 'Lil Blooming n ' reveals themsel!]<br>
A line of constellations was blocking the road leading to the recycling center.<br>
[The scenario is over. Without further compromising probability, go back to your own context.]<br>
"How dare you, how dare you—"<br>
Ares couldn't understand. Why is <Eden> involved in this situation?<br>
Especially at this timing.<br>
Ares bit his lip and revealed his fierceness to the being standing beyond the archangels.<br>
"Center Director! I know you’re hiding there!"<br>
There is no need to fight <Eden>.<br>
After all, the 'Star Ladder' is not under the jurisdiction of <Eden>.<br>
"Cancel the Star Ladder! The 'Demon King of Salvation' is ours!"<br>
[No. Now he belongs to the 'Star Stream'.]<br>
With a hollow laugh, the center director's voice was heard from the archangel's shadow.<br>
[<Olympus>. Have you forgotten the Nebula Agreement? You cannot interfere with the 'Recycling Center' scenario.]<br>
"Asgard has declared [Fate]. Three [Fate] messages have been sent to him! He cannot avoid them! He—"<br>
[The fate that came down to him was to 'die in a loved story'.]<br>
When all the incarnations completed their ascension, the 'star ladder' began to disperse. The portal to the recycling center was closing little by little.<br>
The center director, with a strange smile, left his last words while looking at the ruined Washington Dome.<br>
[I guess that story isn't here.]<br>
"Wait! Wait! You guys—"<br>
['Star Ladder' has disappeared.]<br>
[All scenarios in the 'Washington Dome' area end.]<br>
[The scales of the scenario are tipped.]<br>
[The balance of probability is lost.]<br>
Ares and the great-grade constellations that were left behind hurriedly looked at each other.<br>
Unusual sparks were raging throughout Washington.<br>
"Everyone withdraw—"<br>
[A potential storm begins to blow!]<br>
The aftermath that followed eras everything in Washington.

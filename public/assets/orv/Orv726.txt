726 Episode 28 House (4)<br>
t was not simply an incarnation of a constellation  increased synchronization. That was truly the 'incarnation body' of the Constellation himself.<br>
Why is there a guy like that in a place like this?<br>
The nightmare of Washington East emerged again. Memories of being chased by the constellations along with the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
I came all the way here to avoid them, but I met a constellation here too.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' looks at you pitifully.]<br>
No. Now is not the time to feel intimidated.<br>
[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' tells you to come to your senses.]<br>
Now that I think about it, since when have stories been able to express their opinions to me?<br>
[The story 'Tenacious Martial Arts Expert' says that anything can be done as long as you are persistent.]<br>
Right. Whoever my opponent was, I also didn't have a very easy story to tell.<br>
Above all, my sponsor is the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
As I observed the incarnation of the constellation while taking deep, light breaths, the composition of the story that made up the incarnation caught my eye.<br>
[Exclusive attribute effect activates!]<br>
Now, I guess my sense of vision has improved, and I was able to read fragments of the other person's story just by paying attention.<br>
「I like Little Red Riding Hood」<br>
「Good at collecting wind」<br>
「I hate brick houses」<br>
…<br>
Fragments of old and sick stories are visible.<br>
[The story that makes up this incarnation has been greatly worn.]<br>
Ki Dokja said:<br>
There is no scenario that cannot be conquered.<br>
[During the event scenario, 'wolves' are not killed by other animals.]<br>
I was reminded of Kim Dokja's 'Revolutionary Scenario'.<br>
For example, the 'wolf' now had the same role as the executioner of the demon world.<br>
A position that enters a kind of 'invincible state' during the time when the scenario occurs.<br>
If this scenario were the same, there was also a way to somehow endure the 'night' phase of the wolf and then aim for 'day' when its weaknesses were exposed.<br>
If only it weren't a constellation.<br>
[Young wolf. Do you want to die?]<br>
At the constellation's voice, Killer King was taken aback and took a step back.<br>
Even if it is a weakened constellation, there is an indescribable difference in rank from a normal incarnation.<br>
Killer King probably also knew that fact. That's why he probably chose to survive by protecting his companions instead of attacking the scenario.<br>
Unlike during the Demon World, there are not even 'revolutionaries' in this scenario.<br>
There is no way to kill that 'wolf', day or night.<br>
Killer King came to that conclusion.<br>
[The incarnation can only be killed through the rules of the 'Event Scenario'.]<br>
In my head, I remembered the contents of 'The Three Little Pigs'.<br>
According to the story, a 'brick house' is needed to deal with the 'wolf'.<br>
However, there are no 'bricks' in this worldview.<br>
[If you had chosen 'Wolf', you would have known. Weak animals are eaten. It is neither sad nor painful. It's just the providence of the story.]<br>
"I gave the hippopotamus's front leg."<br>
[I won’t say it twice. Offer one of the 'livestock' you raise. Then, I will leave obediently today.]<br>
Finally, Killer King showed his teeth. Before we knew it, Killer King, who had taken out his bowgun, took a step back and aimed at the wolves.<br>
"Maybe there’s another way to just kill you all here."<br>
The leading wolves frowned.<br>
In this 'event scenario', the wolf is not killed by 'other animals'.<br>
That meant that they could be killed by .<br>
Even if there was a constellation over there, if Killer King had his heart set on it, there was no way he wouldn't be able to catch a wolf or two.<br>
—Kim Dokja. It'll be there.<br>
Killer King’s [ sound] was heard in my ears.<br>
— Run away with your companions. Since you have packed your luggage in advance, you can leave through the back door.<br>
Killer King smiled as he caught a glimpse of where I was hiding.<br>
—Don’t worry about me. I won't die.<br>
Actually, I don't think Killer King is very similar to Yoo Jonghyuk. It is the same as Kim Dokja, who constantly shouted, "I am Yoo Jonghyuk," and cannot become Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
The reason I'm shaking now is probably because I read 'Ways of Survival' right before I came here.<br>
「"I will not die."」<br>
That's what Yoo Jonghyuk of 'Ways of Survival' always said right before he died.<br>
I won't die.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk always left those words behind when he died.<br>
To Yoo Jonghyuk himself, those words must have been true. Because he is a regressor who never dies.<br>
But are those words true for those left behind after his death?<br>
[Kill him.]<br>
At the same time as the constellation gave an order, three wolves rushed towards Killer King.<br>
In an instant, the wolf's claws rushed in, aiming at Killer King's front, back, left and right sides.<br>
[The story fragment 'Heir of the Black Coat' begins its storytelling!]<br>
When did he collect such story fragments?<br>
Killer King's brilliant coat fluttering gesture made his claws snap off cleanly.<br>
A fierce lion's roar erupted from the corner of Killer King's mouth with a heartless smile.<br>
[Fragment of the story 'A person who resembles the voice of the Supreme King' shouts loudly!]<br>
I thought he might be able to imitate regression, but of course I didn't have the courage to test that.<br>
Killer King, who was hit on the back of the head, gritted his teeth and let out a loud noise.<br>
—Kim Dokja! hurry!<br>
It is actions, not words, that determine a person's essence. Sincere actions remain as stories, and they are talked about and become stories.<br>
[The story 'The Lone Savior' begins its storytelling.]<br>
The legend accumulated by Killer King was shining brightly.<br>
It is not the same as Yoo Jonghyuk's, but it is no less noble.<br>
That narrative dominated Killer King. It was leading him to his death.<br>
"If you leave him like that, he will die."<br>
Little Yoo Jonghyuk was right.<br>
If we leave him like this, Killer King will die.<br>
Just like Sergeant Jun Moonho in Seoul Station and Jung Jaewoo in the Theater Dungeon.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk. Let me ask you a favor."<br>
"Ask?"<br>
Little Yoo Jonghyuk looked up at me. Facing his suspicious eyes, I searched for items in the 'Dokkaebi Bag'.<br>
This worldview is a place where the use of 'skills' and 'stigmata' is prohibited. The effect of the item is also halved and it cannot perform as well as it should.<br>
In other words, no matter what I buy from the 'Dokkaebi Bag', there is no way to kill that 'Wolf Constellation'.<br>
However, it may be possible if it takes some time.<br>
[1,000 coins were consumed in the 'Dokkaebi Bag'.]<br>
[The item 'Red Riding Hood (Replica)' has been acquired.]<br>
I placed the items purchased through the 'Dokkaebi Bag' on little Yoo Jonghyuk’s head.<br>
[The item's effect increases the target's attention!]<br>
Little Yoo Jonghyuk was startled and struggled.<br>
The effect of this item is simple.<br>
The wear becomes a little cuter, more appetizing, and attracts attention.<br>
Although the effect of the item is halved here, this should be enough for now.<br>
"What are you doing—"<br>
The moment little Yoo Jonghyuk, who had barely peeked his head out of the hood, stood up, the gaze of the wolf constellation turned towards him.<br>
[The constellation 'The Wolf Who Loves Little Red Riding Hood' finds prey!]<br>
If that wolf was a normal constellation, it wouldn't have fallen into this trap.<br>
But there was something different about him.<br>
I was confident because I had already met several other constellations.<br>
An unstable status for a constellation.<br>
The story contained in its incarnation was unbalanced, and its 'character' was not perfect.<br>
A rag-like incarnation made up of old story fragments that have not been properly repaired for a long time.<br>
Crucially, 'The Three Little Pigs' was not the only story that constituted the incarnation of the wolf.<br>
[The story 'The Wolf Who Covets Little Red Riding Hood' begins its storytelling.]<br>
Constellations that have lived for a long time have difficulty distinguishing between their own will and the will of the story.<br>
As the story began its storytelling, the instinct of the guy who had been consumed by the story awakened.<br>
[Little Red Riding Hood.]<br>
Its bright red, bloodshot eyes began to shine, and it started running toward little Yoo Jonghyuk, wagging its tail like a mad dog.<br>
I nodded solemnly towards little Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
"Let’s run."<br>
"You—"<br>
"If you don’t run fast, you will die."<br>
Little Yoo Jonghyuk gritted his teeth and looked back at me and said.<br>
"I will definitely kill you, Kim Dokja."<br>
Almost at the same time, I ducked for cover.<br>
With the fierce wind blowing, Yoo Jonghyuk and the new form of the wolf constellation disappeared at the same time.<br>
Coo coo coo coo coo.<br>
When I looked up outside the cover, I saw little Yoo Jonghyuk running away and a wolf constellation chasing after him.<br>
It was a dangerous sight, as if he was about to be caught, but Yoo Jonghyuk will be fine. I don't know if the guy's stamina was as low as before, but Yoo Jonghyuk's stamina had recovered quite a bit now.<br>
I saw him sitting on my shoulder, secretly taking out an elixir from his pocket, and consuming it with my own eyes.<br>
He eats eight meals a day, so he should have fully recovered by now.<br>
That's not all.<br>
[The effect of the item 'White Rat Mask' is activated!]<br>
['Animal Mask' does not receive the 'performance reduction effect' of the corresponding world view.]<br>
Is it because it is a 'zodiac' worldview?<br>
'Mask' is the only item here that maintains its original performance.<br>
If the effect of 'Rat Mask', which won first place in the 'Zodiac Race', is that there will be no chance of getting caught for a while.<br>
"You guy."<br>
Meanwhile, Killer King, who had defeated all the other wolves, turned to look at me.<br>
Indeed, the second apostle is Killer King.<br>
Is it possible to subdue a wolf that is not a constellation without using skills or stigmata?<br>
Killer King wiped away his bloody nose and said, glaring in this direction.<br>
"Do you know what you did?"<br>
"I know."<br>
"The southern part of Zone 13 is the territory of the 'wolves'. Now you—"<br>
"I am the enemy of the wolves."<br>
Killer King looked at me as if he was dumbfounded and muttered.<br>
"Have you really become Kim Dokja?"<br>
We started collecting items and story fragments from the fallen wolves.<br>
Some of the story fragments were useful and some were trash.<br>
Not all stories are recycled when they enter the 'Recycling Center'.<br>
"It’s not too late. If you’re going to leave, now is your only chance."<br>
Killer King, who was picking up items, stood up and said.<br>
"Go to another zodiac area. You haven’t lost your mask yet, so there must be a way to escape. I will take care of the rest of the group somehow."<br>
"I don’t like it."<br>
"Kim Dokja.<br>
At first glance, a scar was revealed on the back of Killer King's hand. It was a wound that had never appeared before.<br>
"This is only the eighth scenario. Do you know how many of the characters we know died on the way to here?"<br>
"…"<br>
"You don’t necessarily need everyone to see the ending."<br>
What Killer King said was right.<br>
Not all characters are needed for the ending of this world.<br>
"I and my companions have now accepted it. This world is not the 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' we used to know.<br>
No one knows how many more people will die on the journey to the end.<br>
Some people will live and some people will die. Some will be forgotten and others will be remembered.<br>
I also know Killer King nw.<br>
This story will not end with a beautiful ending like a fairy tale.<br>
"I need you to get the ending I want."<br>
"It’s typical of Kim Dokja to be unreasonable. Are you really going to take on that role? I’m sure you know what that means."<br>
I  looked into Killer King’s eyes. Now I had no choice but to admit it. That person really read 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' a hundred times.<br>
He really knows what I'm thinking.<br>
I opened my mouth, feeling inexplicably comforted by that fact.<br>
"I know."<br>
"Even though you know that—"<br>
"You seem to be mistaken, but the reason you are needed is because you are so useful."<br>
No matter what I do, I cannot become 'Kim Dokja, the Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
Just as Killer King cannot become 'Supreme King Yoo Jonghyuk' no matter what he does.<br>
Killer King looked at me with blank eyes for a moment, then smiled brightly.<br>
"I see. body needs help…"<br>
"Yeah."<br>
Killer King's eyebrows twitched.<br>
"Is there some kind of solution? As of now, even if you and I work together, we can’t catch that wolf."<br>
"In theory, yes. But isn’t there something strange about this scenario?"<br>
"Strange?"<br>
"The name is 'The Three Little Pigs', but the structure of the scenario is very similar to a scenario we know. The wolf’s position and, of course, the fact that the scenario begins at 'night'."<br>
A game to catch a 'werewolf' that kills people by biting them every night.<br>
We already know a ‘scenario’ that is very similar to that.<br>
"Have you ever wondered why this center is called 'Recycling Center'?"<br>
Recycle. It literally means to reuse something that has been used. Killer King, who was thinking about something in response to my question, took a deep breath and muttered.<br>
"No way…"<br>
I don't know who the director of this 'Recycling Center' is or for what purpose this stage was designed. But.<br>
"If what I think is right…"<br>
I swept the dirt off the floor and gauged the flow of the surrounding stories.<br>
Since when did it start?<br>
One by one, the group approached Killer King.<br>
Kyung Sein, Dansu ahjussi, Ye Hyunwoo. And even Cha Yerin.<br>
I thought as I looked at them.<br>
Only the eighth scenario.<br>
As Killer King said, many readers have died. Readers died again and again, as if the world was hostile to them.<br>
"We are the people in the world who can tell this story better than anyone else."<br>
Nevertheless, 'Kim Dokja' still did not die.<br>
"Let’s start the 'Revolutionary Game' now."<br>
From now on, it is Kim Dokja’s time.

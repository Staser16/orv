728 Episode 28 House (6)<br>
Ji Eunyu once said,<br>
"Writer, your sentences are very neat. There is no unnecessary information."<br>
When I first heard that, I didn't think it was a compliment.<br>
"I just don’t have confidence in the sentences I went with."<br>
I am a writer who neither knows how to write elegant descriptions nor write complex sentences<br>
Nevertheless, Ji Eunyu praised my half-baked sentences for my eloquent speaking skills.<br>
"No, that’s not true. How difficult it is to choose and use only the words you need. There are times when you can make a better sentence by just leaving out a few unnecessary words or particles, but than you think."<br>
Ji Eunyu said<br>
Take it<br>
Even if you think you need it, take it out. Think about it and then take it out. Look again and take it out. Anyway, take it out.<br>
Good sentences are built on such solid margins.<br>
Those are really good words.<br>
However, anyone who has ever written anything will know that leaving something out is not that easy.<br>
It is not easy to remove even a single  much less a comma.<br>
This is probably because it involves something that took time to write.<br>
The blank space created by erasing the sentence certainly feels different from the original blank space.<br>
It feels like the soul of a sentence that has disappeared above the margins is alive and hovering around.<br>
As a result, I sometimes had that thought while deleting sentences.<br>
It's not that I don't want to erase the sentence, but maybe the sentence is telling me not to erase it.<br>
Like now, so to speak.<br>
[Story fragment 'The House That is Not a Brick House' refuses your touch!]<br>
The moment I touched the fragment of the story, sparks flew out. A heart-stopping shock hit my chest, and I even drooled like someone who had been electrocuted.<br>
"No, what are you thinking!"<br>
"Sparks strike! Stop!"<br>
Kyung Sein and Dansu ahjussi rushed in and helped me up.<br>
But I couldn't stop. No matter how much I thought about it, this was the only way.<br>
"I think I found a brick."<br>
"Yes? Really?"<br>
The explosion that was echoing in the distance was getting closer. 'Little Red Riding Hood' ran towards us, destroying every building we saw.<br>
And Yoo Jonghyuk, Little Red Riding Hood, was running dangerously in front of us.<br>
"Kim Dokja—!"<br>
There is no time anymore.<br>
I once again grabbed the fragment of the story.<br>
The story fragment was speaking.<br>
「I am not a brick house.」<br>
I realize once again how much difficulty Ji Eunyu has been through all this time.<br>
It is not easy to change what has already been written. What is written is read, and what is read is remembered by those who read it. Memories soon become the basis of reality.<br>
Therefore, changing the story means changing reality.<br>
Tsutsutsutsu.<br>
I had no idea that it would be this difficult to fix just one fragment of a story.<br>
Sparks flew every time the fragment of the story in my hand fluttered.<br>
[Your 'fourth story' has fully blossomed.]<br>
It was then that the message occurred to me.<br>
[The story 'The One Who Rewrites Fate' begins its storytelling.]<br>
「The One Who Rewrites Fate.」<br>
This was the new story I got with 'The Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
[Your understanding of the story 'The One Who Rewrites Fate' is low.]<br>
[You will have 'very little' resistance to probability aftermaths.]<br>
Surprisingly, the effect of this story is a certain level of immunity to 'probability aftermaths'.<br>
When the spark of the story fragment became endurable, [Sentence Enhancement] shone once again.<br>
[Sub-skill 'Sentence Enhancement' is activated.]<br>
[Receives the effect of the story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear'.]<br>
[The trait of 'Story Repair' will bloom in you!]<br>
The struggles of the story fragments were gradually calming down.<br>
[The target is a 'low-level story fragment'.]<br>
[Would you like to edit this 'story fragment'?]<br>
As I slowly touched the fragments of the story, I could clearly feel the sentences written on the story. From the time this story was first created until now, the years that have accumulated on the sentence were vividly conveyed.<br>
「I am not a brick house.」<br>
I looked back at the inn 'The Crane and the Fox' while holding the story tightly. I thought it was strange from the beginning.<br>
Killer King and others also said this. This house is not a brick house, perhaps because the story says so.<br>
But at least to me,<br>
[The 'story fragment' did not convince you.]<br>
This house was a 'brick house'.<br>
The fragment of the story was trembling.<br>
I held on to the fragment of the story and placed my hand on the sentence that came to mind.<br>
Kim Dokja said: There is no scenario that cannot be conquered.<br>
Ways of Survival said. It is said that this world is made up of 'stories'.<br>
I persuade it while holding on tightly to the story. Or [incite].<br>
"You."<br>
Unravel the history accumulated in story fragment. Remove the words written on the fragment one by one. Take out 'n', take out 'o'. Remove spaces between words.<br>
By subtracting, subtracting, and subtracting again, we finally create one neat sentence.<br>
It brings out the original story fragment of a story that has been stained over a long period of time.<br>
"You’re a brick house."<br>
The next moment, the story fragment began to melt together with a bright light.<br>
A brightly shining gemstone of story appeared from the melted debris.<br>
「I am a brick house.」<br>
The fragment said.<br>
「I am a brick house.」<br>
I nodded. Then, I quietly inserted the fragment of the story into the wall of the house.<br>
[Story fragment 'The Brick House' begins its storytelling.]<br>
This world is made up of stories. And the story is made up of fragments of the story.<br>
The smallest particle that changes the world.<br>
The moment that particle hit the wall, reality changed.<br>
Tsutsutsutsu.<br>
The interior of the inn, which was finished with wood, was rippling like waves. The old wood was replaced with hard, dense orange-colored bricks.<br>
My companions opened their mouths.<br>
Cha Yerin closed her eyes as if listening to the story fragment, and Kyung Sein and Lee Dansu touched various parts of the brick house as if they were curious.<br>
"It’s a brick house! It’s a brick house, really!"<br>
"How could this—"<br>
Killer King nodded as if he knew that would happen. Ye Hyunwoo, who was surprised, looked back at me as if asking what I did.<br>
"The Recycling Center is a world made of old stories."<br>
The background of this event scenario is 'The Three Little Pigs'.<br>
In order for this story fragment to be recreated, a 'brick house' is necessary.<br>
But there are no bricks in this world.<br>
"Then, of course, 'bricks' are also made of stories."<br>
What we needed to find in the first place was not a real 'brick' but the story of a 'brick'.<br>
"We have to close the door!"<br>
A pack of wolves came right in front of us. But Yoo Jonghyuk hadn’t come in yet.<br>
I shouted as loud as I could as I closed the door to the brick house.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk! Chimney!"<br>
Through the closing door, I saw little Yoo Jonghyuk nodding.<br>
The sound of something hitting one after another was heard from beyond the closed brick house. Then, I heard something like a flying squirrel running across the roof.<br>
A moment later, little Yoo Jonghyuk, covered in what looked like black soot, jumped out of the fireplace under the chimney.<br>
"Kim Dokja—!"<br>
I left Yoo Jonghyuk's arrival behind and shouted to my companions.<br>
"Boil water in the furnace! Quick!"<br>
『The Three Little Pigs』 started now.<br>
Then, water began to boil under the chimney stove.<br>
[The constellation 'Rat Eating Nails' looks forward to what will happen next.]<br>
[The constellation 'The Cow of the Beginning,' likes it as it is the first reenactment he has seen in a long time.]<br>
[The constellation 'The First Pig To Die' says he is excited for the first time in a long time.]<br>
A strong wind was blowing outside. The wolves are probably forcing air into their lungs with all their might.<br>
[Like this house—!]<br>
In the original work, 『The Three Little Pigs』, the wolves blow down the house the little pigs built with their breath.<br>
The first pig's house made of straw and the second pig's house made of wood are destroyed by the wolf's breath.<br>
However, the 'youngest pig’s' house, built of bricks, is different.<br>
Coo coo coo coo!<br>
A strong wind once struck the house. Two, three, four times.<br>
The wind’ speed was quite strong, so the brick house shook precariously.<br>
Every time that happened, I whispered to the story fragment.<br>
"You are a brick house."<br>
「I am a brick house.」<br>
[Story fragment the 'brick house' becomes even stronger.]<br>
[The constellation 'The Wolf Who Loves Little Red Riding Hood' is astonished!]<br>
I could feel the wolves' agitation beyond the wall.<br>
[How did you build a 'brick house'?]<br>
Now they too are realizing that something is wrong.<br>
[No way… I'm sure I couldn't find that 'story'.]<br>
I expected it.<br>
Obviously, in a normal scenario, fragments of the 'Brick House' story would not be obtained in this way.<br>
What I used was a kind of shortcut.<br>
It was the same principle as Kim Dokja's impersonation of a revolutionary in 'Revolutionary Game'.<br>
Strictly speaking, it is a 'house that is not a brick house' transformed into a 'brick house'.<br>
[Very few constellations ask if that was possible.]<br>
[A constellation that has not yet revealed its modifier nods to your solution.]<br>
A constellation whose modifier is not disclosed.<br>
As far as I know, the only one who has ever sent a message in that form is the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
However, the 'Demon King of Salvation' is currently not in a state to send indirect messages.<br>
So who is the owner of that message?<br>
Perhaps the owner of that message is also like the 'Demon King of Salvation'…<br>
Doo doo doo doo.<br>
I heard something jumping on the brick roof. As expected, the wolf incarnations began to move.<br>
'Little Red Riding Hood’s wolf' shouted.<br>
[Stop, you idiots! This means don’t move carelessly!]<br>
Still, the wolves did not stop.<br>
[Review the reproduction requirements for stage productions in your region.]<br>
In order for a story to be 'staged', several 'conditions' related to the stage, including the 'story', must be met.<br>
For example, in order to reproduce 『Spring of the Demon World』of <Kim Dokja Company>, key members of <Kim Dokja Company>, including Kim Dokja, and the 'chariot' of Surya, a narrative-grade constellation, are needed.<br>
So what about the case of 『The Three Little Pigs』?<br>
[Story fragment 'Leader of the Wolves' begins its storytelling.]<br>
First, the villain of the story, 'Wolf'.<br>
[Story fragment 'The Brick House’ begins its storytelling.]<br>
And the 'brick house', the core material of the story.<br>
The last thing we need is the 'youngest pig', the main character of the story.<br>
But unfortunately, there was no 'youngest pig' here.<br>
[Fragment of the story, 'The Last Born' begins its storytelling.]<br>
Instead, here is me, the 'youngest' Kim Dokja.<br>
[Story fragment 'The Man Who Eats Eight Meals In One Day' begins its storytelling.]<br>
And although the reason is unknown, there was a guy who had fragments of a story that could replace the 'pig' story.<br>
The moment when Yoo Jonghyuk, a frowning little boy, was about to board the flag.<br>
[Representation requirements for staging were incompletely met.]<br>
[The story 'The Three Little Pigs' begins its storytelling.]<br>
「Staging」 has begun.

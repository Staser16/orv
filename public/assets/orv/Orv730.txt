"I think so too."<br>
In a situation like this, who doesn't know that something is wrong?<br>
My mind was complicated.<br>
Was the ending also a problem?<br>
Constellations prefer certain revenge, unexpected developments, and exciting endings. But what I chose was the lukewarm ending called 'Reconciliation with Wolves'.<br>
[Some constellations belonging to the nebula <Zodiac> are criticizing your actions!]<br>
[A very small number of constellations look dissatisfied with the outcome you chose.]<br>
Of course, the constellations would not like it.<br>
If you think about it, something similar happened when Kim Dokja declared that he would not kill the 'Disaster of Floods'.<br>
Geaaaa—!<br>
'Little Red Riding Hood' began to struggle and howl. The guy, who had hit his head on the floor several times as if in pain, opened his eyes wide and looked up into space.<br>
It was the same for me, little Yoo Jonghyuk, and the rest of the group.<br>
Something was coming down the black open . At first, I thought it was an Outer God, but fortunately, that wasn’t the case.<br>
The first thing I saw was a pig's head.<br>
The moment I saw the whitish tail, a slight shiver ran down my spine.<br>
There was no shock like when I met the Outer God or when the great-grade constellations descended.<br>
Still, my senses were warning me.<br>
[The constellation 'The First Pig To Die' is glaring at you.]<br>
They are the ones who occupy the lower sky of this star stream.<br>
[The constellation 'Pig that builds houses out of wood' is staring at you.]<br>
They were great figures of the Chinese Zodiac.<br>
[The constellation 'liverless rabbit' is looking down at you.]<br>
Indirect messages from the constellations announcing their appearance one by one.<br>
As many as three constellations appeared at once, which would have been startling under normal circumstances.<br>
However, despite that, there wasn't enough pressure .<br>
Looking closely, I saw that each of the powerful constellations had the appearance of a symbol.<br>
...Is that why?<br>
'The first pig to die' was a pig's head with a  in its mouth.<br>
'Pig that builds houses out of wood' is a log with a pig tail growing like sprouts.<br>
Lastly, the 'liverless rabbit' was in the form of a bright red raw liver.<br>
Anyway, I never imagined that the constellations would come directly as symbols. This is because, no matter how 'symbolically' they descended, descending into a lower-level scenario incurs a considerable probability cost.<br>
In my mind, I remembered the record of 'Ways of Survival' regarding the 'Recycling Center'.<br>
「The Recycling Center is a kind of floating castle that travels around lower-tier scenarios.」<br>
「The Recycling Center has a thin border with the other world in order to accommodate 'various types of stories'.」<br>
「Constellations that have been recognized for their area within the Recycling Center can use symbols at a relatively low cost.」<br>
Perhaps the reason the constellations were able to descend as symbols was because of the special environment of the Recycling Center.<br>
By the way, why did those bastards attempt to 'descend symbolically' at this moment?<br>
They probably know that it's dangerous because they can't fully use their original power if they are in a symbolic state.<br>
[It’s been a while, wolf.]<br>
My doubts were quickly answered.<br>
The moment I heard their mantra, I realized it right away.<br>
[It’s still a smelly place.]<br>
[Are there any new turtles?]<br>
The fact that they took risks and attempted to 'descend symbolically' shows that they are confident.<br>
[All the prisoners in Zone 13 kneel in front of the Nebula Zodiac.]<br>
It was proof that no one in this 'Zone 13' would dare to oppose them.<br>
The owner of the crane and the beastmen who were hiding in each house ran out of the house one by one to show their respect.<br>
The same was true for our group. Ye Hyunwoo, Kyung Sein and Cha Yerin, and Dansu ahjussi were all prostrated on the floor.<br>
It would not be their own will. This was simply the power of the Zodiac, the nebula of animals.<br>
[The constellation 'The Wolf Who Loves Little Red Riding Hood' pays homage to the owner of the story.]<br>
Little Red Riding Hood’s wolf was also bowing his head to the floor.<br>
The only ones who didn't kneel were Killer King, who was tied to a chair, me, and little Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
'The First Pig To Die’ stared at me quietly  spoke to the wolf constellation.<br>
[Have you forgotten your 'contract' with us?]<br>
The wolf growled and his shoulders shook.<br>
[No. Absolutely not.]<br>
I didn't understand.<br>
That one was just a pig and this one was a wolf.<br>
Looking at the laws of the ecosystem and the logic of the law of the fittest, it was clear that carnivores were stronger than herbivores.<br>
Nevertheless, the wolf was trembling like a prey that had encountered a top predator.<br>
[You should be thankful just for continuing the lineage of parasites like you.]<br>
The 'liverless rabbit' said sarcastically.<br>
[Pig teachers, I told you so. All wolves should be killed. Do you know how many of my compatriots they preyed on?]<br>
[I can’t count them.]<br>
[You should be grateful if you hired those guys as 'villains'. How dare you try to change the original story of a sacred tale?]<br>
The wolf constellation did not respond and just shed a sweat. I could see the story of the guy being crushed in real time screaming.<br>
[Some constellations of the nebula <Zodiac> enjoy the suffering of the wolves.]<br>
I think revenge for the weak is right. I also believe that the person who was harmed has the right to return what was harmed.<br>
[Story fragment 'Hunted Wolf' cries.]<br>
[Story fragment 'Little Red Riding Hood' cowers in fear.]<br>
I had no intention of pointing out whether their ways were correct or not.<br>
But…<br>
No matter how I looked at it, this stage was somehow distorted.<br>
[Didn’t you promise? You will pay for the crime your brother committed.]<br>
Suddenly, a sentence from 'Ways of Survival' crossed my mind.<br>
「Animal-shaped constellations often take on the original sin of a race in exchange for sharing that story.」<br>
Some stories go beyond individuals, to species, and even from generation to generation.<br>
The wolf constellation hurriedly put down his head and said.<br>
[Well, didn’t we promise to raise a wolf as a tribute this month as well? The wolf will be ready.]<br>
[It must be a plump wolf.]<br>
[Of course. He gained weight by eating a lot of animal meat—]<br>
Fragments of other beastmen's tales—the wolf harvesters who roamed around collecting 'meat' came to mind.<br>
A hippopotamus struggling with its arm cut off. The prisoners donating meat but not blaming the wolves.<br>
Is it.<br>
Why did the wolves want 'meat'—<br>
[That's strange. The wolves that have been coming up as tributes recently aren't that chubby, are they?]<br>
[That's because of the lack of supply of stories in Zone 13... There are not enough recent local story fragments. If we no longer exploit prisoners—]<br>
[Should I take your situation into consideration?]<br>
[No! I was wrong. I will offer up a wolf that has somehow grown fat, a wolf that has been fed a lot of story fragments, as an offering!]<br>
Only then did I begin to understand many things.<br>
The reason why the story fragments of the prisoners here were all a mess.<br>
The reason why the arms and legs of prisoners were replaced with machines.<br>
[We have already been patient enough.]<br>
Just as the constellations of <Olympus> used giants as their sacrifices, the pigs of <Zodiac> exploited other beastmen at the Recycling Center and received 'wolves' as tribute every month.<br>
Just to continue their legacy.<br>
[The story 'The Three Little Pigs' is complaining about hunger.]<br>
The pig-headed symbol slowly descended to the ground and slowly looked around at the wolf incarnations.<br>
The moment one of the wolf incarnations screamed and tried to run away, its head exploded.<br>
The pig head laughed, chewing on the head wearing the wolf mask.<br>
[He’s a guy who doesn’t even have anything to eat. I don’t even have enough soup to cook.]<br>
[Sorry!]<br>
[Can’t you hear the story’s voice? The story wants a sacrifice. Are you hoping that its existence will be erased from the <Star Stream>?]<br>
[Please give me one more chance. I will do well!]<br>
[Then.]<br>
The Pig Constellation said.<br>
[Prove it.]<br>
He felt the fur on his arms rise. The sound of a story’s song reached my ears. The staging was starting again.<br>
[Offer tribute.]<br>
The wolf looked up at the pig's head with trembling eyes.<br>
The Pig Constellation continued to speak.<br>
[Reveal your ugly nature and die.]<br>
At the pig's command, the wolf constellation slowly stood up.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo said while holding my sleeve.<br>
"We need to get into the house."<br>
Kyung Sein was the same.<br>
"Inho-ssi! It’s none of our business. Run away. Quickly. If you don’t run now—"<br>
The prisoners who were prostrated hung their heads and trembled.<br>
"Oh, no! Please forgive the wolf! Forgive him!"<br>
"Please, great <Zodiac>—"<br>
Little Red Riding Hood’s wolf looked back at them. He saw prisoners with missing limbs and fragments of their stories that had lost their speech.<br>
And he said.<br>
[All right. I will be the 'tribute'.]<br>
From the beginning, this was a story with a fixed end. A story that everyone can watch with confidence. There is a set protagonist, and the stage ends only when the set villain dies.<br>
[「Staging」 resumes.]<br>
An ominous aura began to flow from the entire body of the wolf constellation.<br>
That wasn't all.<br>
Our brick house was growing.<br>
[The influence of the story fragment 'Brick House' becomes stronger!]<br>
A brick house that looks as if it can withstand any wolf attack, reminiscent of Gong Pildu's [Armed Fortress].<br>
"Ah, ah, it was all wrong—"<br>
"Everyone run away!"<br>
The frightened prisoners began to run away one by one into the brick house.<br>
The 'pig that died first', who was watching with satisfaction, looked back at me for the last time.<br>
[The one who is favored by monkeys. You found the right answer. Our story will become even greater with the 'brick' you found.]<br>
[Don’t even think about interfering. If you successfully complete the story, you will also receive a reward.]<br>
With those last words, the constellations ascended back to heaven.<br>
[Some constellations in the nebula <Zodiac> want the destruction of the wolves.]<br>
The muscles of the wolf constellation began to twitch. It was a sign that the power of 「staging」 was about to dominate his entire body.<br>
"Stop!"<br>
I shouted at the guy.<br>
But my words didn't reach him. A fierce wind was already blowing throughout the entire body of the Wolf Constellation.<br>
Little Yoo Jonghyuk, who was standing next to me, took a step forward and said.<br>
"Are you planning to change the story?"<br>
I nodded.<br>
"Pig? It’s just like the Chinese Zodiac guys say. If you stay like this, you can get a new story."<br>
"I know. But if that happens, the remaining incarnations in this area will—"<br>
"You must have felt it from the beginning: the 'beasts' here wanted us to become the wolves’ victims."<br>
I know. So, the crane owner guided us to an old 'guest house'.<br>
"The wolves here exploit these beastmen to obtain fragments of stories. They feed them to one of the wolves and offer them as an '' to the pigs."<br>
"…"<br>
"Whether the beastmen or the wolves die is none of your business."<br>
"That too. But—"<br>
"This world calls that hypocrisy."<br>
Hypocrisy.<br>
I laughed bitterly.<br>
"This world looks a lot like a place I used to know."<br>
It was sweet, but definitely different.<br>
The 'demon world' I knew was not like this. Good and evil were a little more clear than this.<br>
Maybe this is also a result of 'recycling'.<br>
"I don’t have any particular cause. I just—"<br>
What would Kim Dokja do?<br>
"I just don’t like this story."<br>
I didn't even think I could persuade him. However,<br>
"If you oppose the Chinese zodiac, you will die."<br>
I hesitated for a moment and asked.<br>
"Are you really worried about me?"<br>
"If it takes just a moment, you can break through."<br>
Little Yoo Jonghyuk's small fists were filled with unusual magical energy.<br>
[Baekbo Shinwon].<br>
It was impossible. Because [skills] cannot be used in this worldview. Even when he became a kid, Yoo Jonghyuk is still Yoo Jonghyuk?<br>
The guy created his skill [100 Steps Divine Fist] purely through his own talent.<br>
"Please."<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk's fist punched into the air. In an instant, an explosive vortex surrounded the wolf, creating a wound in the wind.<br>
I dug into the gap and grabbed the wolf constellation by the shoulder.<br>
"I told you to stop!"<br>
My voice was scattered in the harsh wind. To the point where communication is barely possible. At this rate, outside constellations will not be able to hear our voices.<br>
[The house… Go in. You… This story… It cannot be changed.]<br>
It was not simply because of 「staging」. The guy's long shadow was looming.<br>
"Did they cause your to run away?"<br>
[If you are at home… safe. There… Remember the wolf’s last story.]<br>
I knew of several constellations where shadows had run away.<br>
He will die soon.<br>
Even if he doesn't die, he will be in the same state as dead.<br>
The wolf constellation laughed as if it had read my eyes.<br>
[Me… Are you sympathizing?]<br>
"Pity? Do you think I’m such an idle person?"<br>
To begin with, the <Star Stream> is a broken world.<br>
This world is just a 'story'.<br>
All stories sparkle and are consumed by fleeting emotions.<br>
Over a long period of history, causes and effects have become mixed, and harm and damage have become indistinguishable.<br>
All that remains is the laughter and cheers of the stars.<br>
Even though I know that,<br>
"Don’t you want to create  new 'stor of wolves?"<br>
I can't give up on the story.<br>
This is the last story in which he will shine as a constellation.<br>
After hitting that brick house several times, he will fall down the chimney and die a horrible death.<br>
And to future generations of wolves, he will be remembered as the new wolf of 「The Three Little Pigs」.<br>
"Are you really going to end it like this?"<br>
The wolf constellation's eyebrows twitched greatly.<br>
[You … there’s…]<br>
"I know what you’re going to say. There’s nothing you can do. You’re going to die anyway. The Zodiac is a nebula you can’t handle."<br>
Even though he is a constellation, he is a fallen constellation who has lost all his stories.<br>
No matter what he does, he cannot beat the <Zodiac>. It is impossible to destroy the 'stage' that has been solidified by the gaze of constellations over hundreds and thousands of years.<br>
But there are things even such a constellation can do.<br>
"Sacrifice your  to summon the God of the Other World."<br>
Ruining this stage.<br>
[What… Are you talking nonsense? If you do something like that…]<br>
"The existing 'stage' will be destroyed. And a new story will begin."<br>
The wolf's eyes widened as if wondering what  was talking about.<br>
[Then Zone 13 is—]<br>
"Don’t worry. I will stop the God of the Other World'."<br>
The wolf's voice trembled harshly, as if he belatedly understood what I meant.<br>
[You can’t possibly be—]<br>
"That's right."<br>
I nodded.<br>
"I plan to steal the story of 'The Three Little Pigs'."

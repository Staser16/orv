733 Episode 28 House (11)<br>
Ye Hyunwoo, Cha Yerin, and Dansu ahjussi, who were supplying magical power, turned to look at Yoo Jonghyuk at the same time.<br>
The expressions on their faces asked if he was really speaking in his right mind.<br>
Dansu ahjussi with cognitive dissonance asked.<br>
"What did you just say…"<br>
I could also hear Ye Hyunwoo muttering quietly.<br>
"Ha, there was a setting like that."<br>
Killer King, who was tied to a chair, also shook his head in admiration.<br>
"He was the true Supreme King."<br>
He is truly the Supreme King, and if he continues like this, the entire story will fall apart. The brick house was getting thinner in real time.<br>
[The representation of 'staging' is weakened!]<br>
When the 「staging」 collapses, the tale will stop its storytelling.<br>
In that case, the constellations that were forcibly tied to this stage will be able to leave the scene without any significant damage.<br>
[Some of the constellations in the nebula <Zodiac> are taunting you.]<br>
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' makes an excited expression.]<br>
[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' is curious about your plan.]<br>
If things continued like this, everything, whether it was a plan or not, was going to fall apart along with this brick house.<br>
The dust and sand that fell down  on my face. I looked down at the fallen dirt and asked.<br>
"Can’t you just not eat 'food' made by others?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk looked at me.<br>
"What?"<br>
Isn’t it enough to fill your stomach no matter what you feed it?<br>
"You, you can’t—"<br>
For the first time, a feeling of fear appeared in little Yoo Jonghyuk's eyes. Anyway, I held the powder in my hand and brought it to his mouth.<br>
"Eat, you bastard!"<br>
Little Yoo Jonghyuk stubbornly rebelled.<br>
My companions looked at me at the same time.<br>
"Are you really feeding him dirt right now?"<br>
"No, no matter how you do that to a child—"<br>
"As expected, Kim Dokja."<br>
I ignored their words and forced little Yoo Jonghyuk's mouth open and let out what was in my hand. Yoo Jonghyuk's trembling neck moved.<br>
I barely sighed and said.<br>
"You can’t eat real dirt, right?"<br>
Of course, it might be possible to use the [Incite] skill, but I didn't want to go that far here.<br>
"Ah."<br>
Cha Yerin found a  on my hand and let out a small exclamation. It seemed like she realized late what this was.<br>
What I fed was fragments of stories.<br>
More precisely, it was a part of the 'story fragment' that the 'Heir of the Eternal Name' had swallowed.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' looks dissatisfied.]<br>
[Your lifespan decreases.]<br>
A 'story fragment' that I managed to obtain through my earnest request.<br>
"If it’s a story fragment, this guy could eat it too."<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, who has had a twisted personality since birth, has a 'set value' in which he does not eat food unless he has made it himself.<br>
Of course, there is an exception with 'Murim dumplings', but I don't know how to make them.<br>
So the next best option was 'story fragments'.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk. Come to your senses."<br>
This is because even Yoo Jonghyuk, who does not eat food prepared by others, has received stories from other people.<br>
The problem is that the look in Yoo Jonghyuk's eyes when he received it was slightly bitter.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk?"<br>
If possible, I wanted to avoid doing this.<br>
In 'Ways of Survival', it is said that Yoo Jonghyuk once received a wrong transfusion of military story from Lee Hyunsung and briefly turned around.<br>
But for now there was no other way. I had to feed him something to fill his stomach.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' grins.]<br>
Wait for a sec. But what is the story that Yoo Jonghyuk s obsessed with now?<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk was trembling and his eyes were rolling. The guy just looked up at me and put his head down on the floor.<br>
And.<br>
"No, wait a minute."<br>
Wack wack. Wack wack.<br>
"Hey! Spit it out! Pick something up and eat it!"<br>
Either way, the guy started digging up the dirt. Yoo Jonghyuk's eyes slowly returned to their senses. The guy with dirt on the corner of his mouth glared at me with wide eyes.<br>
"You bastard, you made me suffer, right?"<br>
The loud-mouthed Killer King answered for me.<br>
"It’s dirt."<br>
"I don’t eat dirt."<br>
"No, you eat dirt. That’s Yoo Jonghyuk."<br>
Killer King pointed to the window with his chin. Little Yoo Jonghyuk looked at his own mouth reflected in window with blank eyes.<br>
I tried my best to ignore the look in the eyes of little Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
[Story fragment 'The man who eats eight meals a day' is satisfied.]<br>
[The conditions for 'staging' have been met.]<br>
[The constellation 'The First Pig To Die' screams.]<br>
The story has been enriched once again. As the crumbling stage became solid once more, the pig constellations that had been preparing to step back rushed forward again.<br>
[The constellation 'Pig who built his house out of wood' groans.]<br>
Cheer up, pigs. If you don’t want the story to be taken away by a wolf.<br>
[Some constellations in the nebula <Zodiac> are showing hostility towards you.]<br>
The storm started to rage again.<br>
*<br>
I don't know how much time has passed. Have I been this exhausted since I was trapped in the ichthyosaur's stomach?<br>
[The head of the Recycling Center admires your determination.]<br>
The party members who were supplying magical energy were also exhausted one by one. Some people were leaning against the wall, gasping for breath or completely fainting.<br>
I too was on the verge of losing my mind. What made me endure was the story engraved on the other side of the wall.<br>
「A wolf howled in the storm.」<br>
A storm came and the brick house withstood the wind. A story was created every time the wind left a scar on the wall.<br>
「A lone wolf who lost his home asked.」<br>
It is a new story of wolves.<br>
「"Is that your home?"」asked the lone wolf.<br>
「"Then where is my home?"」<br>
The brick house did not answer.<br>
「"If I can’t have a house."」<br>
Then the wolf spoke.<br>
「"I will not stop the storm until every house in the world is destroyed."」<br>
All stories are written on the 'wall'.<br>
Because there is a wall, events finally become 'stories' and the constellations can safely indulge in stories.<br>
[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' is impressed by your 'hands-on-slaughter' skill.]<br>
[Animal-shaped constellations that are not part of the Chinese zodiac are amazed by your story.]<br>
, feel free to take a look.<br>
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' likes the sensibility of the wolves.]<br>
[Some constellations from the Chinese Zodiac are angry at your story.]<br>
I used the characteristic of [Circulatory ] to gather as much magical energy as possible to strengthen the 'Brick House'.<br>
I wanted to make this story continue a little longer.<br>
[The constellation 'The First Pig To Die' screams!]<br>
[The constellation 'Pig That Built its House out of Wood' cries out for help!]<br>
It was then that something snapped.<br>
I felt my stomach turn, and a handful of blood spilled onto the floor. My head was dizzy.<br>
The moment I raised my head to see what was going on.<br>
[The story 'The Three Little Pigs' is destroyed.]<br>
[Some of the constellations corresponding to 'Pig' in the Chinese zodiac have suffered a huge blow to their true bodies!]<br>
[The constellation 'The Pig That Died First' exits the scenario.]<br>
[The constellation 'The Pig That Built its House out of Wood' exits the scenario.]<br>
Only then did I realize what had happened.<br>
['Staging' ends.]<br>
The constellations were defeated.<br>
['The God of the Other World' roars!]<br>
[Some of the constellations belonging to the Nebula <Zodiac> are afraid of the 'God of the Other World'.]<br>
Perhaps it was natural.<br>
No matter how low the level of the 'God of the Other World' was, there was no way that a great-grade constellation could rush in and suppress the power of the Outer God.<br>
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' mocks the constellations, asking if they are just that scared.]<br>
From now on, it was a complete gamble.<br>
"Don’t open the door."<br>
Little Yoo Jonghyuk spoke quietly as if he knew what I was going to do.<br>
"If you go out, you will die."<br>
"Even if we stay here, everyone is still going to die."<br>
"But—"<br>
"Do not worry."<br>
I lightly tapped little Yoo Jonghyuk on the shoulder and then spoke.<br>
"No one will die."<br>
When I opened the door, the streets of Zone 13 appeared, engulfed in silence.<br>
It was strange. It's so quiet even though a storm is raging.<br>
Nevertheless, the pressure pressing down on my entire body was several times stronger than when I faced the 'Wolf Constellation' earlier.<br>
It didn't take long to realize what was happening.<br>
「Eye of the storm.」<br>
Now our 'Brick House' was exactly in the 'center' of the storm.<br>
Now, 「Staging」 cannot protect us. If the storm twists in any direction, the brick house will be torn to pieces.<br>
"O great god of the other world."<br>
I took a slow, deep breath and said.<br>
"Stop the storm. Haven’t you had enough of the stories?"<br>
A new story that sprouts in the place where the story of 「The Three Little Pigs」 was destroyed.<br>
[Your new story begins to germinate.]<br>
This story will now become the story of the wolf and us.<br>
And maybe the 'God of the Other World' who led this storm can also receive a share.<br>
"The ending of every story is important."<br>
'Gods of the Other World' have different levels depending on the status they have.<br>
The ancient species that once shook the entire scenario is crowned as the 'Old One', and the dominant species that filled the entire universe with fear is crowned as the 'Great Old One'.<br>
But whatever their original grade, they all have something in common.<br>
"You can now go 'home'."<br>
Deities who were excluded from the scenario and lost their constellations bodies to stay in.<br>
They endlessly wander around the world, looking for a place where they belong. After a long wandering, someone becomes a disaster in another world line, and someone else even colludes with dokkaebis.<br>
"The story can only be completed if you stop the storm here."<br>
And someone makes an 'otherworldly covenant'.<br>
['The god of another world' is looking at you.]<br>
All 'Gods of the Other World' are terribly lonely.<br>
"It means you will have a constellation body to stay in."<br>
My body trembled just from him looking at me. If it was a normal incarnation, it wouldn't be strange if blood spilled from my eyes.<br>
Still, I was able to endure it.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' yawns lightly.]<br>
The 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is a story about defeating the 'founder of the Absolute Throne'.<br>
In other words, I was more resistant to the gods of the other world than anyone else in this world.<br>
In fact, the god of this world seemed perplexed when he saw me like that.<br>
But even for a moment.<br>
【My house disappeared a long time ago.】<br>
The terrible storm began to move again. A force that seems to tear me to pieces at any moment.<br>
"Four winds meet to form a direction, and four more winds are added to that direction. It forms the tomb of the eight trigrams."<br>
I slowly closed my eyes and felt the wind blowing.<br>
As if I had become a 'wall'.<br>
As if the story of that wind would be engraved on my body.<br>
I uttered the sentence with all my might, as if I was pressing down to write it.<br>
"Thereby the wind exists everywhere and nowhere."<br>
For an instant, the storm that had been rolling in stopped like magic.<br>
【How do you know that enlightenment?】<br>
Through the storm that was slowly clearing, the appearance of the God of the Other World was revealed.<br>
I smiled as I looked at that guy's story.<br>
"How would I know?"<br>
It seemed like the Wolf Constellation had safely summoned the 'God of the Other World' I mentioned.<br>
However, I was not sure that the 'God of this world' was the 'wolf' of the 'world line' I knew.<br>
Nevertheless, just as Asmodeus came in this 41st round, and just as <Kim Dokja Company> appeared here—if that wolf also overcame the long time and finally became a 'God of Another World'.<br>
Slowly, the wolf with wide eyes approached me.<br>
【No way.】<br>
If I were 'Lee Hakhyun', this gamble would have been impossible.<br>
But now I was acting under the name of 'Kim Dokja'.<br>
If so, there is a possibility.<br>
[The synchronization rate with the sponsor is increasing!]<br>
The wolf hurriedly came towards me. Looking at his height, which seems to be about three meters, his first description came tomind again.<br>
「He is about three meters tall. He is a wind fighter with both monster-like stamina and giant-like strength.」<br>
The wolf slowly lowered its gaze towards me. And he looked at me for a long time, as if reading the story buried in my eyes.<br>
【Ho, hogu? Is it really you?】<br>
He is the 'guide' of the destroyed planet Kronos.<br>
The prince of Imyuntar who taught Kim Dokja the [Way of the Wind].<br>
"It is, Lycaon Isparang."<br>
Kim Dokja once said: It is said that those who make a 'covenant of this world' will not be able to see the true ◼️◼️.<br>
But in the end, he too made a covenant with another world. He probably couldn't find the answer either. Because this damned world is designed so that no matter what you do, you can't reach the right ◼️◼️.<br>
Same goes for me.<br>
"ake a '' with me."<br>
No matter how much I thought about it, this was the only way to fight against the Zodiac.<br>
*<br>
[Some constellations belonging to the nebula <Zodiac> request a 'probability judgment' regarding the 'Zone 13' incident.]<br>
[Some constellations belonging to the nebula <Olympus> ask for your permission to enter the 'Recycling Center'.]<br>
[Some constellations belonging to the nebula <Veda> ask for your permission to enter the 'Recycling Center'.]<br>
[Some constellations belonging to the nebula <Tamra>...]<br>
Indirect messages from constellations pouring in endlessly.<br>
When the Recycling Center director waved his hand in the air as if he was annoyed, the messages scattered like a swarm of insects.<br>
A screen appeared where the messages were scattered.<br>
A screen showing the scenery of Zone 13.<br>
[As you know, I like 'old stories'.]<br>
The head of the Recycling Center smiled as he saw the incarnation and the wolf confronting each other on the screen.<br>
[Seeing that you are moved by that story, it seems that your story has already become an 'old story'.]<br>
As he said that, he looked back at the flask behind him.<br>
Inside a huge flask the size of a person was a man wearing a white coat with his eyes closed.<br>
The Recycling Center director asked, slowly placing his hand on the wall of the flask.<br>
[How many points would you give to that story, Demon King of Salvation?]

734 Episode 29 Recorder of fear (1)<br>
「The universe is a very large secret room. There is a wall at the end of the secret room. We have never touched that wall.」<br>
—Recorder of Fear<br>
*<br>
Belonging to the planet Kronos.<br>
Prince of the Imyuntar race and the first wolf—'Lycaon Isparang'.<br>
This wolf, who appears as a guide in the 'fifth scenario' in the main story, was a character whose whereabouts were unknown after clashing with another guide, 'Antinus'.<br>
"Is it really that 'Lycaon'?"<br>
After the identity of the 'God of the Other World' was revealed, the party members expressed their surprise in different ways.<br>
Dansu ahjussi, who could not join in on the surprise, asked hesitantly.<br>
"Who is Lycaon?"<br>
"You know, the guide from the 'Disaster Scenario'. The wolf from the meteorite."<br>
"Oh, that … wasn’t he dead?"<br>
"There was no mention of his death. His whereabouts became unknown after that."<br>
"Yes. That’s true, but…"<br>
Ye Hyunwoo, who was shaking his head at Killer King’s words, glanced at me.<br>
"Dokja-ssi, how did you know that 'Lycaon' had become a god of another world?"<br>
Indeed,  thought Ye Hyunwoo would ask. Even though he has read it  times than the other apostles, he is the most quick-witted.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo even called me 'Dokja-ssi'. That probably means that he expects this answer to be like 'Kim Dokja'.<br>
"I wasn’t even sure. It was a gamble."<br>
Not surprisingly, there was no additional setting or follow-up story regarding Lycaon.<br>
There are bound to be characters whose importance decreases as the scenario progresses, and Lycaon was also a character who naturally exited in that way.<br>
However, I did not mention Lycaon as a candidate for 'God of the Other World' without thinking.<br>
"It just occurred to me. Perhaps among the people we know, there are individuals who have evolved into 'Outer Gods'."<br>
Many of the 'Gods of the Other World' in the main story were left without seeing the 'end' of the scenario.<br>
Most of them lose their ego and become 'nameless', but sometimes there are those who maintain their ego outside the scenario and increase their power by becoming Outer Gods.<br>
For example, 'Asmodeus' who appeared in this round was of that type.<br>
So that's what I thought.<br>
Perhaps among the characters who are not fully described in the main story, there may be someone who has become a 'god from another world'.<br>
"It was a gamble with very low odds."<br>
Ye Hyunwoo was right.<br>
The odds were low.<br>
However, this was the 'Recycling Center', and I thought there was a high possibility that that kind of probability would have a positive effect.<br>
And above all.<br>
"There were two alternatives besides Lycaon."<br>
"Three precautions. As expected of Kim Dokja."<br>
"Who were the other two?"<br>
"As you know, among the gods of another world, there is another being related to 'wolves'."<br>
As I said those words, I looked down at little Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
Is this because the previous battle was too much?<br>
Or did he get sick from eating dirt? Yoo Jonghyuk was lying on the floor, completely exhausted.<br>
I put a thin blanket over him.<br>
"'Kkoma Yoo Jonghyuk' also appeared in the main story."<br>
The second 'Outer God' I was going to call did not have a story related to 'wolves'.<br>
However, there was a scene in the main story where he was compared to a 'wolf', so I thought it might be possible to call him that.<br>
"Hmm. Do you mean 'King of the Lone Wolves'?"<br>
"But would the 'being' respond to the summons?"<br>
"The probability would have been low. In fact, we haven’t even seen him in this round."<br>
The second 'Outer God' I considered was a 'Secretive Plotter'.<br>
However, the 'Secretive Plotter' had reached his ◾️◾️ and crossed into a completely different world, so there was no certainty that he would respond to the call.<br>
"Then what about the third?"<br>
"The third is..."<br>
I looked up at the sky. In fact, the third response probability was as low as the second.<br>
The third one was even less related to 'wolves'.<br>
However,  a world where 「a man who eats eight meals a day」 is recognized as a 'pig'.<br>
"Wolf ears headband. Do you remember?"<br>
「The man wearing the wolf ears headband」 may also be recognized as a 'wolf'.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo, who was thinking about something, opened his mouth.<br>
"Wolf ears? When they went to the amusement park in Oz…"<br>
"Yes, that’s right."<br>
In a world where all of Kim Dokja's memories become stories, the story of going to the amusement park with Han Sooyoung would certainly survive as fragments of stories.<br>
[A constellation whose modifier has not yet been revealed is looking at you.]<br>
Even if he is not a deity from another world,  Kim Dokja, who possesses that 'story fragment', exists.<br>
If Kim Dokja is a being with a modifier like the 'Demon King of Salvation'…<br>
['Sub-scenario—The Three Little Pigs' has ended.]<br>
At that moment, a scenario ending message appeared.<br>
[500 recycled coins were obtained as a reward.]<br>
[You have cleared the scenario in a way no one has tried before!]<br>
[Your achievements will transform the very foundation of the scenario!]<br>
[The story 'The Three Little Pigs' loses influence in the <Star Stream>.]<br>
"Ah—"<br>
The surrounding scenery shimmered and the night began to fade.<br>
Only then did my companions' faces brighten one by one, as if they realized it.<br>
The event scenario has been lifted and 'wolves' can no longer threaten us. Because the 'wolf' has just joined our side.<br>
"If we’re going to fight the <Zodiac> in the future, we’ll need that guy’s power."<br>
I looked back at Lycaon, who was standing about ten steps away.<br>
Kyung Sein asked with a slightly frightened expression.<br>
"Is it okay? He’s a god from another world."<br>
"There is nothing to be afraid of as a god from another world. Even in the main story, they negotiated with a god from another world."<br>
From earlier, Lycaon had been muttering something at the sky.<br>
Perhaps he is exchanging messages with the Management Bureau regarding the 'Otherworld Covenant', or perhaps he is negotiating with the 'Recycling Center'.<br>
I sighed lightly and looked back at my companions.<br>
"And here. These are the 'masks' we recovered earlier."<br>
One of the main purposes of this 'scenario' was to obtain new 'masks' for the group to use.<br>
"Ah. When did this happen—"<br>
It was a mask obtained from previously deceased wolf incarnations.<br>
"Are you sure you don’t mind if we take it?"<br>
When Dansu ahjussi lowered his head as if he was sorry, the other party members also lowered their heads as if they were being shamed.<br>
Kyung Sein said in a trembling voice.<br>
"I-I really couldn’t be of any help."<br>
"No, you all did well."<br>
I slowly looked back at my companions and spoke emphatically.<br>
As the party members who recovered the masks put them on one by one, their bodies, which had been transformed, began to return to their original state.<br>
Instead, faces that reflected the characteristics of their time as prisoners appeared on the surface of the mask.<br>
Kyung Sein is a squirrel.<br>
Dansu ahjussi is a turtle.<br>
Cha Yerin is a snail.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo is a panda.<br>
As expected, the 'mask' seemed to reflect the user's original characteristics.<br>
Then, why am I still thinking, 'I’m free from impunity'? Is there any animal that looks similar?<br>
While the group was breathing a sigh of relief, Killer King, the only one among them who had not lost his mask, approached me.<br>
"By the way, you were lucky this time. You know that."<br>
I nodded and said,<br>
"The 'original owner' of the story did not intervene."<br>
The reason why this 「staging」 collapsed faster than expected was because the original owner of the story, the 「Pig in the Brick House」, did not help us.<br>
If the 'Pig In The Brick House' had intervened on stage, the fight would not have ended so easily.<br>
Of course, even if that happened, it wasn't the worst.<br>
Even if the 'pig' won and the existing narrative was strengthened, we were fighting on the 'pig' side anyway. Even if I couldn't write a new story, I would have benefited from it in some way.<br>
Anyway, I was curious.<br>
Why didn't the 'Pig in the Brick House' intervene on stage? If I think about it, it was a constellation that had been watching me from the beginning of the scenarios.<br>
"Ah, ahhh… I know what you guys are doing!"<br>
"We’re all going to die! We’re all going to die!"<br>
After the scenario was over, the prisoners hiding under the table came out one by one.<br>
"The other Zodiac signs will not forgive Zone 13."<br>
"Why, why are you doing this—"<br>
I smiled bitterly as I looked at the terrified prisoners.<br>
Since I couldn't fill up after the first drink, I didn't have high expectations. Because people who are stuck in this scenario are afraid of change.<br>
But not all incarnations were like that.<br>
The crane owner was looking at me with an expression of disbelief.<br>
"Did you say Kim Dokja…?"<br>
Some stories are unchanging prisons.<br>
A prison that restricts existence to a set frame, repeats the same schedule, and transforms it into mere material.<br>
But the prisoners saw with their own eyes that the prison could be broken.<br>
[Your new 'story' begins to influence 'Zone 13'.]<br>
[The name of 'Kim Dokja' is starting to become known at the 'Recycling Center'!]<br>
That's enough for now.<br>
I stood side by side with Killer King and watched the beastmen for a moment.<br>
"The Demon World scenario would have been similar to this."<br>
"I guess so."<br>
"It’s my favorite scenery."<br>
Before we knew it, Ye Hyunwoo, who had changed his mask, came towards us.<br>
The moment Killer King opened his mouth, his eyes  as if he was dissatisfied with Hyunwoo standing next to him.<br>
"Inho-ssi. But is it okay? You can continue to work under 'that name'"<br>
"7th Apostle. This guy is Kim Dokja—"<br>
"I’m asking Cheon Inho now, not Dokja-ssi."<br>
I looked into Ye Hyunwoo’s clever eyes beyond the mask.<br>
Come to think of it, there was once a problem with Ye Hyunwoo over using the name Kim Dokja.<br>
"Are you uncomfortable?"<br>
"No, not really. I admit it now. Inho-ssi is the one closest to that name among us. However."<br>
For a moment, I thought I knew what he was worried about.<br>
The story of the <Star Stream> is more sensitive to names than anything else.<br>
That is, if I were to impersonate Kim Dokja—<br>
"If this continues, all the stories Inho-ssi builds will become 'Kim Dokja’s' stories."<br>
That was a sharp point.<br>
"It’s okay. It was intentional."<br>
"You did that on purpose?"<br>
Actually, I had a crucial reason why I impersonated 'Kim Dokja' when I entered the 'Recycling Center'.<br>
[A new story begins to be recorded under the name of 'Kim Dokja'.]<br>
Along with the message, the newly germinated power of the story floated within me.<br>
The name hasn't been decided yet.<br>
A story that has not been lost.<br>
Still, is it because I am also the 'youngest Kim Dokja'? Part of the story was absorbed into me, but the rest slowly rose upward through the ceiling of the Recycling Center.<br>
[Your story will be shared with your sponsor.]<br>
I felt a small sense of relief as I saw the tail of the story moving away.<br>
Thank god. He's still there.<br>
"A similar thing happened in the demon world. Do you remember?"<br>
"You mean when Kim Dokja impersonated Yoo Jonghyuk?"<br>
All stories have a main character and are written around that main character.<br>
While I am impersonating Kim Dokja, the stories I have accumulated will continue to raise Kim Dokja's status.<br>
The created story will make Kim Dokja's name known, and people will call Kim Dokja's name.<br>
And Kim Dokja will also hear that name.<br>
"Wait a minute, it can’t be—"<br>
"I thought about it for a long time. But no matter how much I thought about it, it seemed like this was the only way."<br>
I liked this 41st round. So I hope this world line does not perish.<br>
However, I know that if I protect this world line, other world lines may be destroyed. A much bigger disaster may occur than what happened in the main story.<br>
But the tragedy has not yet been written and the story continues.<br>
So I can do it.<br>
Just what I need.<br>
「A being who can 'reread' all the endings of this story.」<br>
Someone who can turn my 'square circle' into reality.<br>
"I intend to ing 'The Oldest Dream' on this world line."

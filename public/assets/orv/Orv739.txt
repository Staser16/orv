739 Episode 30 Zodiac (1)<br>
「The essence of the Chinese zodiac lies in the creation and destruction of all things, and this means that it does not represent any animal.」<br>
—『Understanding the Unemployed』<br>
*<br>
After the scenario began, most people stayed up all night with their eyes wide open.<br>
A situation where you never know when and where a monster or enemy will appear.<br>
Fatigue can be alleviated by consuming 'Elaine Forest Spirit' or restorative medicine, so there was no need to take risks unless there was a sleep penalty.<br>
A world where sleep has become a luxury.<br>
In that sense, all incarnations living out the scenario had lost their dreams.<br>
The same was true for the incarnations in front of me right now.<br>
The prisoner, who had been trapped in the prison of a scenario for a long time and had forgotten to dream, asked.<br>
"A-are you really going to change the story?"<br>
The crane owner looked at me with a nervous expression.<br>
"I can change it for you."<br>
"If the <Zodiac> finds out..."<br>
"The <Zodiac> can’t come."<br>
I pointed to the entrance of the inn with my chin. Lycaon was sitting there, cross-legged, with his eyes closed.<br>
Several beastmen looked at each other and nodded.<br>
They also confirmed Lycaon's power. There was no fear of not believing what I said.<br>
"What story can I change?"<br>
"That is…"<br>
“Is it 'The Fox and the Crane'?"<br>
"How did you know?"<br>
How do I know? There is nothing to do.<br>
[The story 'The Fox and the Crane' has been discontinued.]<br>
This is because after repairing the story fragment 「Brick House」, I could gradually see the flow of stories floating around this 'Zone 13'.<br>
The crane owner sighed lightly and opened his mouth again.<br>
"Recently, the status of my story has become unstable."<br>
In order for a 'story' to maintain its original function, the actual owner of the story must be continuously active in the <Star Stream>, or the story must be continuously talked about.<br>
"So, I tried to tell the story through a 'staging', but I couldn’t stage it on my own."<br>
I guess so. That's because the story isn't just about the crane.<br>
"Are there no foxes in Zone 13?"<br>
The crane owner nodded his head with a sigh.<br>
"There used to be one, but the last fox disappeared a few months ago."<br>
"What happened to the last fox?"<br>
"We stopped hearing from him after he was captured by the Zodiac."<br>
<Zodiac>.<br>
It was obvious why they did what they did.<br>
[The presence of the story 'The Fox and the Crane' opens up.]<br>
This is probably because it would be difficult if someone who has built up a legend in Zone 13 threatens their position.<br>
I slowly looked around at the beastmen.<br>
Perhaps some of these were constellations, like the 'wolf' in 「The Three Little Pigs」, or were beings that came close to being constellations.<br>
It's just that as time goes by, they lose their own story and their original status.<br>
The owner muttered in a weak voice.<br>
"The fox is probably dead."<br>
Perhaps that's what the 'story' said.<br>
Because he and the fox are tied together by stories.<br>
"At first, I thought about disposing of the stories in the <Zodiac>. If I hand over the stories there, even if the stories are deformed, their status will be maintained."<br>
I thought of the wolf constellation struggling to maintain 「The Three Little Pigs」.<br>
"But I couldn’t do that. I didn’t want to bow down to the guys who captured the fox, even if it meant losing the story."<br>
The owner lowered his head as he said that.<br>
"I know that I have to let go of the story now. It’s a story I can’t protect alone, and it’s not particularly important to the <Star Stream>. But…"<br>
A strange desire was shining in the eyes of the crane owner who slowly raised his head.<br>
"I thought you might have a way."<br>
I nodded.<br>
"There is a way."<br>
"Really?"<br>
A scenario message suddenly appeared before my eyes.<br>
It's probably a scenario initiated by the 'Recycling Center Director' or the management bureau who was watching the situation.<br>
[A new sub-scenario has arrived!]<br>
+<br>
<Sub Scenario – The Fox and the Crane><br>
Category: Sub<br>
Difficulty: C<br>
Clear condition: Succeed in reproducing the story 『The Fox and the Crane』.<br>
Time limit: —<br>
Reward: 12,000 recycled coins or 2,000 recycled coins and an unidentified story fragment<br>
Failure: —<br>
+<br>
The situation was different from the time of 「The Three Little Pigs」. Since the situation did not specifically involve the <Zodiac>, there was no hesitation in participating on stage.<br>
The problem is finding a role to play the role of a 'fox'.<br>
Killer King raised his hand.<br>
"I will do it."<br>
"Killer King-ssi is a wolf."<br>
"Just change it to wolves and cranes."<br>
"If  want to make a staging,  need a fox."<br>
However, no one in our group had a 'fox mask'.<br>
Fox, fox.<br>
It would be nice to have a story similar to 'Fox'.<br>
Oh, wait a minute.<br>
[Check the delayed 'compensation list'.]<br>
Now that I think about it, there was a 'story reward' that I had not received yet.<br>
[Check the rewards for the seventh main scenario.]<br>
[Currently, 'S-class skill selection' is waiting to be received.]<br>
[Currently, 'historical-grade story selection' is waiting to be received.]<br>
Even if it's 'S-level skill selection', 'historical-grade story selection'?<br>
I guess this wasn't the original scenario reward?<br>
[You have achieved an impossible feat in the seventh main scenario.]<br>
[The Bureau recognizes your achievements.]<br>
[The scenario reward 'random historical-grade story' has been upgraded to -grade story selection'.]<br>
The management bureau did something helpful for the first time in a while.<br>
Well, considering what happened at the Washington Dome, upward payment is quite possible.<br>
By the way, it is a historical-grade story selection.<br>
Historical-grade stories are mostly trash, but there are some useful ones, such as 「The Persistent Murim Master」.<br>
There are also things that display processing abilities when fused, such as 「earrings when worn on the ear」or 「nose rings when worn on the nose」.<br>
I checked the reward list with some anticipation.<br>
[Check the list of historical-grade story rewards.]<br>
[You can choose one of a total of 461 stories.]<br>
461.<br>
Could it be that some of this is useful?<br>
+<br>
1. Poop pretending to be soybean paste<br>
2. Cat with tanned whiskers<br>
3. Silla-Tang Allied Forces<br>
…<br>
+<br>
For some reason, all I could see were lame stories.<br>
There is also a story that would have happened if the Demon King of Salvation was next to me.<br>
I continued to look at the stories.<br>
Number 10, Number 30, Number 50, Number 100..<br>
+<br>
122. I’m not getting my hair cut.<br>
123. Head Shoulders Knees Toes<br>
124. A chef who can’t distinguish between salt and sugar<br>
125. Ornamental Beard Specialist<br>
+<br>
Occasionally, stories that seemed to come from the 'Random Story Box' were also seen.<br>
As the ranks passed the 200th, and even the 300th mark, an ominous feeling slowly came over me.<br>
No matter how I looked at it, it seemed like they had just picked up and collected stories discarded by other constellations.<br>
There  even stories like 「Earrings on your ears」.<br>
The moment when I finally felt resigned to whether or not I should give up.<br>
+<br>
461. Owner of the Fox Ears headband<br>
+<br>
I looked closely at the last story that came out.<br>
Why on earth is this story here?<br>
'Owner of the Fox Ears Headband’'<br>
According to my thoughts, this 'story' was definitely that 'story'.<br>
Probably when <Kim Dokja Company> visited the amusement park in <Oz>.<br>
「"What are you doing here?"<br>
When I turned around, Yoo Jonghyuk was there, wearing a fox headband as expected.」<br>
… Even if it’s not that story, it doesn’t matter. Anyway, since 'fox' was included, it was a story that could be used immediately.<br>
'I will choose number 461.'<br>
[The historical-grade story, 'Owner of the Fox Ears Headband' has been acquired.]<br>
I immediately started talking.<br>
Of course, if you use this 'story', a fox that wasn't there won't suddenly appear.<br>
After all, what is included in this story is not a fox, but 'fox ears'.<br>
[The story 'Owner of the Fox Ear Headband' begins its storytelling.]<br>
I looked at my mask reflected in the window.<br>
It is said that in this world, the 'mask' is a story that protects oneself.<br>
But if this 'mask' is really a story.<br>
'Stick.'<br>
It would also be possible to tie together stories and stories.<br>
'Stick.'<br>
How many times has the story been told like that?<br>
[The story 'Owner of the Fox Ears Headband' responds to your will.]<br>
My mask began to emit a faint light. The prisoners watching us nearby let out exclamations.<br>
"Oh, oh—!"<br>
The shape of my previously invisible mask changed in real time. The mask's snout grew pointed, and small ears also sprouted from its head.<br>
It literally looks like a 'fox mask'.<br>
[The story 'The Fox and the Crane' is looking at you.]<br>
The owner of the crane also held my hand with an expression of emotion.<br>
"So, you… were you the fox?"<br>
"No."<br>
The fox in this story is dead.<br>
Even if I were to act as the fox's replacement and successfully stage the story, the story would only be talked about for a moment.<br>
"I can help you, but even if you recreate the 「stage」 like this, the effect will only be temporary."<br>
"I know that."<br>
As in 「The Three Little Pigs」, there may be ways to change the plot of the story and introduce new stories or make other animals appear, but these are also temporary measures.<br>
"Don’t you want to become famous again?"<br>
"What do you mean?"<br>
"Originally, 'The Fox and the Crane' is a story as famous as 'The Three Little Pigs'.<br>
The owner looked confused.<br>
"Don’t you want to share your story with the <Star Stream> once again?"<br>
Creating a story that everyone knows about in the <Star Stream>. It is the dream of every constellation shining in the sky.<br>
"As you know, the reason Zone 13's stories are weakening is because you're trapped in the Recycling Center."<br>
"I know, but we can’t leave the center."<br>
"You are like that. But what about 'stories'?"<br>
The crane owner looked at me with an expression of disbelief.<br>
I nodded and added.<br>
"We are spreading the story inside the Recycling Center throughout the <Star Stream>."<br>
"That’s impossible. The constellations outside the center cannot know what happened inside the center. The stories that occur here cannot possibly become famous."<br>
"In principle, yes."<br>
And from here was the second stage of my operation.<br>
'Bihyung'.<br>
If you can't see it, just make it visible.<br>
'Please open the channel.'<br>
*<br>
—You crazy person!<br>
As expected, Bihyung appeared quickly.<br>
—You crazy person! You crazy guy!<br>
'Stop and listen to me.'<br>
—Shut up, you crazy!<br>
'…'<br>
—Outside now, do you know what's going on? Are you out of your mind?<br>
'What happened?'<br>
—Are you asking because you really don’t know? Have you forgotten what you and your sponsor did right before entering the 'Recycling Center'?<br>
I remembered what happened at the Washington Dome.<br>
—The constellations are now gathering outside the Recycling Center, you know?<br>
'What constellations?'<br>
—Who could it be?<br>
I can roughly guess.<br>
<Asgard>, <Olympus>, <Ghost>, <Veda>, <Tree of Protection>.<br>
There must have been a lot of constellations from the nebulae that were targeting us from the Washington Dome.<br>
There will also be other constellations of the nebulae that flock to us after hearing the rumor.<br>
When I think about it, it's a little scary.<br>
—Do you feel it now?<br>
Considering the scale of what I and the 'Demon King of Salvation' had done, it was not strange.<br>
The 'Demon King of Salvation' killed dozens of great-grade constellations belonging to each giant nebula in 'Gingagap' of the mythical stage <Asgard>.<br>
Where is that?<br>
He even defeated 'Ares', who was narrative-grade and was listed as one of the 12 gods of <Olympus>.<br>
Naturally, the constellations of <Asgard> and <Olympus> would have been greatly strengthened. Other nebulae may also be starting to become curious about us.<br>
Some nebulae must have confirmed that the contract between me and the 'Demon King of Salvation' has not been terminated.<br>
—I'm sure you'll be trapped in the underground torture chamber of 'Tartaros', where you'll be treated horribly, your ego will be removed, and you'll be used as a doll weapon!<br>
'That's very specific.'<br>
—So you must never get caught.  definitely hidden inside the 'Recycling Center'. Never go outside. Outside constellations cannot enter here, so you'll be safe...<br>
'Thank you for your concern.'<br>
—Why would I be worried about you? I'm just afraid that the value of my product will be damaged! Do you remember that our contract was extended? Your sponsor…<br>
'I know.'<br>
—Who knows that? Let's open the channel?<br>
'I'm not asking to open a live channel. We want to open a channel through which only stories can be distributed.'<br>
—No, what are you talking about…<br>
'If the product has value, you must sell it before its value falls.'<br>
—What?<br>
'I heard everyone is waiting for me?'<br>
Even if I'm trapped inside the Recycling Center, there's something I can feel.<br>
[The power of the story 'The One Who Rewrites Fate' becomes stronger.]<br>
Even now, the story of the Demon King of Salvation and me is becoming famous.<br>
However, at this exact moment, I, the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation', ended up in the 'Recycling Center'.<br>
As Bihyung said, this is a place where external constellations cannot intervene or spy.<br>
The constellations' curiosity about me will continue to grow.<br>
'Then I have to live up to their expectations.'<br>
We cannot remain trapped in the 'Recycling Center' forever. The moment will surely come when I have to escape from here and face the nebulae.<br>
Until then, the vast gap between the constellations and me must be bridged.<br>
'Bihyung, you like coins, right?'<br>
And in this <Star Stream>, there is a very efficient means to fill that gap.<br>
[The story 'The Fox and the Crane' has stopped its storytelling.]<br>
[The story 'The Magpie Who Returned the Favor' has stopped its storytelling.]<br>
[The story 'The Goose that Laid the Golden Egg' has stopped its storytelling.]<br>
…<br>
I said, rewriting my mask.<br>
'From now on, I plan to appear in all stories of Zone 13. So you—'<br>
After all, trends come and go.<br>
I grinned as I looked at the endless 'recycled stories'.<br>
'Sell the stories I will appear in to the constellations who pay coins.'

742 Episode 30 Zodiac (4)<br>
Spots and thin cuts.<br>
A few fluttered and fell to the floor due to Ye Hyunwoo's wind.<br>
I looked down at the hair and said.<br>
"If it is reasonable for someone who has nothing more to lose to become 'Kim Dokja', then it is not right for Hyunwoo to become Kim Dokja as well."<br>
"I know."<br>
To conclude, Ye Hyunwoo's attack was not directed at me.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo's wind passed by me and collided with something in the air on the other side.<br>
The sound of something falling on the floor. Sounds reminiscent of the claws of large animals were scattered about.<br>
When [Way of the Wind] was activated from Ye Hyunwoo's fingertips, the face of the assassin hiding in the alley was revealed.<br>
"Tsk-"<br>
The assassin had the face of a bear. The so-called bear beastman.<br>
It was an animal that had never been seen here before.<br>
The guy must have sensed danger and immediately growled and ran out of the alley.<br>
But Ye Hyunwoo was faster.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo, who flew [Way of the Wind], was already standing behind the beast.<br>
Quad deuk.<br>
The bear's knees bent to opposite sides, making an eerie sound.<br>
As the bear howled in pain, Ye Hyunwoo grabbed the back of its neck and asked.<br>
"What are you doing, you?"<br>
A completely different tone from usual. Gurgling, blood bubbles flowed from the mouth of the frightened bear beast.<br>
"Who ordered you here? Tell me. If you don’t speak until the count of three, you will die."<br>
A  tone of voice that he never showed in front of me. I once again realize what kind of person he is.<br>
He is the 7th apostle of the Apostolic Association and the actual representative of Chungmuro.<br>
"One."<br>
While coming this far, Ye Hyunwoo must have been caught up in countless plots and schemes that I was unaware of.<br>
The bear beast panted and spoke as if in a fit.<br>
"You will never succeed."<br>
The prisoner was left lying limp on the floor. It looks like the stories and magic power he had were not enough.<br>
It was almost surprising that a surprise attack was attempted in this condition.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo frowned.<br>
"Shall we wake him up again and torture him the Kim Dokja way?"<br>
It was then that I heard a system message in my ears.<br>
[Your approval rating drops.]<br>
[Currently, 68% of prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]<br>
It was strange.<br>
Since the start of full-scale narrative repair, the approval rating has not fallen even once.<br>
But why is the approval rating dropping at this time?<br>
[Your approval rating drops.]<br>
[Currently, 67% of prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]<br>
Ye Hyunwoo also looked at me, probably feeling uncomfortable.<br>
"Something doesn’t feel right. I guess my companions…"<br>
I saw a group of shadows approaching through a dark alley.<br>
Lanterns rising one by one from the darkness.<br>
It wasn't like they came to ask for a change in the story. This was because the faces of the prisoners swaying like ghosts above the lanterns were unfamiliar.<br>
Not only the face but also the size was the same. Their physiques are at least twice as large as those of the beasts in the nearby area.<br>
[It was true that the southern wolves were exterminated.]<br>
A mantra that sends shivers down your spine.<br>
There was a brown bear there, a meter taller than the other beasts, wearing a skull mask that covered half of its face.<br>
[The constellation 'A bear that will   pretend to be dead'’s eyes are flashing.]<br>
Judging by the  felt and the atmosphere it gave off, there was no doubt about it.<br>
That guy is a 'great-grade constellation'.<br>
[The story that makes up this incarnation has been greatly worn.]<br>
To be precise, it is the incarnation of a great-grade constellation that has lost most of its stories and whose status has been greatly reduced.<br>
An animal-type constellation that failed to enter the <Zodiac> and remained in Zone 13.<br>
It seemed to be a similar case to 'The Wolf Who  Little Red Riding Hood', which we fought against before.<br>
In the darkness, the brown bear's huge claws gave off a cold light.<br>
[Kill them all. The southern part of Zone 13 is the 'Bear' area from today.]<br>
After repeating his words in unison, the bear beasts began plundering, crushing all the surrounding houses with their huge paws.<br>
"W-what! Kwaaaaaaaa!"<br>
Claws flew in without asking or answering. The prisoners, their entire houses torn apart, were screaming.<br>
[Your approval rating drops.]<br>
[Currently, 66% of the prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]<br>
I understand why the approval rating continues to decrease. Those bears were randomly slaughtering the prisoners in Zone 13 who supported us.<br>
Looking at the numbers, the number of troops seems to be well over 300.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo opened his mouth.<br>
"That guy is the same case as the 'wolf' back then, right?"<br>
"Yes. I think we need to be careful. This time, there is no story to use."<br>
With the wolves, the 「Three Little Pig」 scenario was in effect, so staging could be used.<br>
This time the case is different.<br>
But Ye Hyunwoo had  eyes.<br>
"Here, would I be like Kim Dokja by taking the lead and fighting, or would I be more like Kim Dokja if I had to hide behind and encourage my companions?"<br>
I thought for a moment and then answered.<br>
"They both  like Kim Dokja."<br>
Kim Dokja would have been at the forefront of the fight while encouraging his companions to  behind the scenes.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo nodded his head as if he understood what I said.<br>
"Then I’ll do as I please here."<br>
Black magic power flowed from Ye Hyunwoo’s whole body. I was a little surprised because it was my first time seeing him truly start a story.<br>
[The story 'Armless Panda' growls.]<br>
Originally, Ye Hyunwoo was a supporter-type incarnation who mainly used [Magic Charge] and [Magic Sharing] skills.<br>
A skill position with a combination in mind with Gong Pildu, who uses [Magic Turret] from the beginning.<br>
However, here, Ye Hyunwoo gained the power to change his position.<br>
"Kaaaaak!"<br>
Every time Ye Hyunwoo's sword moved, there was a cracking sound of something breaking. It was the same fist that had grazed my mask earlier.<br>
The bears who  Ye Hyunwoo screamed.<br>
"Bear?"<br>
"Stop! We are the same kind!"<br>
"I’m not a bear."<br>
Ye Hyunwoo said without a smile, holding a bamboo stick near his mouth.<br>
"I’m a panda."<br>
Most of the beastmen in Zone 13 are incarnations whose stories have been damaged.<br>
However, the were also people who had made a name for themselves before joining the 'Recycling Center'. Those prisoners were unable to stop Ye Hyunwoo and fell out one after another.<br>
Now Ye Hyeonwoo has combat power comparable to that of the highest-level incarnations, even with his support-related skills sealed.<br>
"Oh my god, is this guy really him?"<br>
"The 'panda' is here!"<br>
"Kill the damn story thief!"<br>
A story thief?<br>
As the angry bears all rushed towards Ye Hyunwoo, Ye Hyunwoo's hands and feet also  to get busy.<br>
Just then, my colleagues sensed the commotion and ran out from inside the brick house.<br>
"What are those bears?"<br>
"No, those bastards— Hyunwoo-ssi!"<br>
Dansu ahjussi, Kyung Sein, and Cha Yerin, who must have been sleeping, also rubbed her eyes and stuck her face out the window.<br>
Afterwards, the crane owner came out screaming. The crane owner, who quickly looked around, seemed to have realized what was going on.<br>
"Brown bear! What on earth are you doing? Why are you doing this—"<br>
The brown bear paid no heed to the crane's words and continued to trample on the southern house site.<br>
Kyung Sein asked with a frown.<br>
"What are those bears?"<br>
"These are the bears that rule the northern part of Zone 13. They never crossed over when there were wolves…"<br>
The crane owner, his beak clenched, answered.<br>
"I don’t know either. Why are they suddenly doing something like this… I heard that the northern beastmen are also showing favor towards them recently."<br>
[Your approval rating drops.]<br>
[Currently, 65% of the prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]<br>
In the end, the crane owner also made a decision.<br>
"All southern beasts, take up arms! Defend your home from the northerners!"<br>
"Those who are injured, hide inside the brick house!"<br>
The situation was not good. If this is the case, it will ultimately lead to conflict between the north and south.<br>
[Your approval rating drops.]<br>
[Currently, 64% of the prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]<br>
The fight must be stopped.<br>
If we cannot stop it, we must at least protect the prisoners in the southern region.<br>
"If you can’t fight, just pretend to be dead! Then you have a chance of survival!"<br>
The modifier of the brown bear that leads the bears is 'a bear that willif  pretend to be dead'.<br>
Judging by the story, if you're lucky, there's a chance that 'pretending to be dead' might work.<br>
But that too is nothing more than a makeshift.<br>
[Your approval rating drops.]<br>
[Currently, 63% of the prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]<br>
How do we stop fighting?<br>
Let's think. There is a reason for every incident in the <Star Stream>. There may be a reason why the bears came to the south now.<br>
At that time, a shout from a corner caught my ear.<br>
"Kill the panda!"<br>
"Why does it appear in all the stories!"<br>
"What’s so fun about chewing bamboo all the time!"<br>
"I can roll around too!"<br>
No way.<br>
"Caught!"<br>
A bear whose nose was hit by Ye Hyunwoo  out.<br>
The number of bear beasts that Ye Hyunwoo had defeated had already exceeded ten, but the bears were still desperately clinging only to Ye Hyunwoo.<br>
The reason was obvious.<br>
"These bears want to become 'pandas'."<br>
I shouted with all my magic.<br>
"Everyone, stop!"<br>
One by one, the bears surrounding Ye Hyunwoo turned to look at me.<br>
"I will help your stories become famous again."<br>
The bear beastmen's eyes were shaking when they heard what I said. It works.<br>
"There’s no need to fight like this. If you’re jealous of the panda, you too can—"<br>
[Shut up!]<br>
With the brown bear's mantra, the bears stopped. The bears looked at each other and bared their teeth at us again.<br>
[Kill him! Don’t let anyone who pretends to be dead live!]<br>
I didn't understand. I told them this much, but they're still attacking me?<br>
I activated 「Persistent Murim Master」 and cut down the two charging bears.<br>
As I watched the bears' claws that had been clawing at me break apart, I realized how serious their condition was.<br>
Each and every one of the seemingly fearsome bear beastmen was in need of immediate reinforcement.<br>
These are people whose balance in their incarnation body has been completely destroyed due to the accumulation of life in the impoverished Zone 13.<br>
They were attacking, ignoring their own lives.<br>
[The story of the lost name is falling apart.]<br>
Tales that are so old that it is unclear whether they can be staged.<br>
Stories whose names have even disappeared and even  the <Star Stream> has forgotten them.<br>
A conversation with Lycaon from a few days ago flashed through my mind.<br>
【I understand what student wants to do. But not everyone be saved by student.】<br>
At the time, I didn't know what that meant.<br>
【Can we force our dreams on those who have lost their own stories forever, student?】<br>
There are people in the world who have lost 'their own story' forever.<br>
"Kill the panda! If you kill it, you will get the story!"<br>
"It’s mine. It’s mine!"<br>
"Aim for him! He has more stories than the panda!"<br>
"There’s a wolf over there too!"<br>
In a world where their own stories disappeared, what they could do was limited.<br>
"Aim for the brick house! Most of the new stories are held by the beastmen over there!"<br>
Stealing other people's dreams.

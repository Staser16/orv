744 Episode 30 Zodiac (6)<br>
The possibility of a nebula.<br>
I read the message over and over again.<br>
My heart was beating deeply. Even though there is no incarnation that has become a constellation yet, there is a 'possibility of a nebula'.<br>
Perhaps this is also the influence of the newly developed story?<br>
The voices of the group rejoicing were heard from afar.<br>
"They say a new story is sprouting?"<br>
"This can’t be—"<br>
"It was worth including a panda every time I repaired a story fragment."<br>
"Is it really because of that?"<br>
This is a story that neither I nor Han Sooyoung can write.<br>
It was a story that was not found in 'Ways of Survival' or 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' and could only be created by those who read it.<br>
The story was now slowly sprouting before our eyes.<br>
「People who wanted to see the story of a very 'big house'.」<br>
I felt certain that it was fate.<br>
Someday I will transcribe their stories. The emotions and scenery of this moment will be sketched out in crude sentences.<br>
I held on to 'Unbreakable Faith'.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk, please protect the brick house."<br>
For the story that will be written someday, I must hold the sword now.<br>
We must protect this moment.<br>
As I slowly blinked, the sound disappeared from my ears. Instead, all I could hear was the sound of stories talking.<br>
[Exclusive attribute effect activates!]<br>
Some stories were familiar and some were unfamiliar. There were disturbing stories, and there were also sad stories.<br>
「I hate pandas」<br>
「I want to be like a panda too」<br>
「All you have to do is defeat the southern guys and steal their stories.」<br>
「Actually, I don’t want to do that.」<br>
And there was a story floating around about bears.<br>
A story that incites the bears’ desires.<br>
[Story fragment 'Fanning' continues its storytelling.]<br>
「Fanning」.<br>
It was the identity of the story fragment that moved the bear beastmen.<br>
Someone must have used this story fragment to fuel the bears' desire and lead them here.<br>
I looked closely at the way the fragments of the story had been spread.<br>
While the constellation 'A bear that saves pretend to be dead' and other bear beastmen are all affected by this 'story fragment'—<br>
「There was one bear that was unaffected by this 'story fragment'.」<br>
The moment our eyes met, he turned his back to me and started running away.<br>
[The item 'Sylphid’s Leap Boots' activates!]<br>
[The item’s performance is halved due to the scenario effect.]<br>
It doesn't matter if it's halved.<br>
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' opens its eyes!]<br>
[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' admires your judgment!]<br>
Fortunately, he wasn't that fast.<br>
Dead end street.<br>
Without hesitation, I swung my 'Unbreakable Faith' at him. With a popping sound, the bear's appearance changed.<br>
There was a 'rat' the size of a small child.<br>
[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' is looking at you!]<br>
「The zodiac.」<br>
It was definitely true.<br>
He is a 'rat', one of the Chinese zodiac animals, belonging to the 'characters'.<br>
I tensed and held the hilt of the sword tightly.<br>
If that is really the <Zodiac>, it must be a constellation of at least great-grade level.<br>
The 'bear that will come back to life if you pretend to be dead' that was talking in the vacant lot was also a constellation, but it was not of the level of a proper great-grade.<br>
But the <Zodiac> is different.<br>
A proper 'great-grade constellation'.<br>
It was a difficult opponent for me now. All kinds of thoughts flowed quickly through my head.<br>
I expected that the <Zodiac> was related to this matter, but I had no idea that the constellations from the <Zodiac> would be there in person.<br>
Should I run away?<br>
Or should I give it my all and give it a shot before it shows its true power?<br>
What if we use stories?<br>
What if we use Kim Dokja’s story from 「Heir of the Eternal Name」?<br>
Or-<br>
[Now, wait a minute—]<br>
Unexpectedly, it was the rat who spoke first.<br>
[Don’t hurt me! I didn't come to fight!]<br>
"What?"<br>
Something was strange.<br>
The use of mantras and indirect messages, as well as the sensations felt, were clearly from a constellation. But the constellation barely has this level of status?<br>
[I was just watching! I’m curious about what kind of guys you are—]<br>
If you think about it, it was strange that a proper constellation appeared with its incarnation in tow, but there was no repercussions.<br>
This is the eighth scenario area. If a 'great-grade constellation' had unleashed its true power, the scenario should have exploded a long time ago.<br>
However, there were no signs of a probability aftermath in the surrounding area.<br>
"Don’t lie."<br>
[It-it’s true!]<br>
After buying some time by saying something, I observed the guy.<br>
The incarnation of the 'Nail-Eating Rat' is a small, small rat.<br>
No matter how much I tried to sharpen my senses, I could barely feel any fighting power. At this level, it was safe to say that it was almost below a symbolic body.<br>
What is his purpose? Why on earth did he appear here in such an incarnation?<br>
I narrowed my eyes.<br>
The scream of a brown bear was heard behind me.<br>
Finally, the group began to herd the bears. I said, looking back at the bodies of the dead bears.<br>
"That’s what you guys did. You used story fragments to control the bears. Are you going to act like a fool?"<br>
[Well, that might be so! But I didn't order it! I swear!]<br>
[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' shouts that it is real!]<br>
A strangely fearful 'Nail-Eating Rat'.<br>
I glared at that guy and said.<br>
"You didn’t do it?"<br>
The 'Nail-Eating Rat' nodded enthusiastically.<br>
"Then why were you here?"<br>
[I told you earlier! I just want to see you in person—]<br>
"Say it straight."<br>
As I took a step closer and aimed with 'Unbreakable Faith', the 'Nail-Eating Rat' made a 'hissing' sound and quickly continued speaking.<br>
[Yes, actually, I came to ask for an alliance. You guys are also going up to the next 'floor', right?]<br>
"Alliance?"<br>
The eyes of the 'Nail-Eating Rat' rolled to both sides.<br>
[You guys are planning to fight against the Zodiac. Right?]<br>
"You are also part of the Chinese zodiac."<br>
[That's true, but I'm a little different. So, I…]<br>
At that moment, I had a strange feeling.<br>
Rat eating fingernails.<br>
Come to think of it, this constellation was one of the constellations that had been watching us from the beginning.<br>
A constellation that even appeared in my ' selection'.<br>
In other words, this guy has been watching the story of me and my companions for a very long time.<br>
That means.<br>
"You-"<br>
A puzzle that slowly comes together in my head.<br>
There were several constellations that showed behavior patterns that were clearly different from 'Ways of Survival' or 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' that I had suspected from the beginning.<br>
The 'Nail-Eating Rat' was one of them.<br>
The 'Nail-Eating Rat' must have found some hope in my tone of voice and shook his head fervently.<br>
[Yes, that’s right. I am also like you. Me too.]<br>
The guy with his eyes tightly closed seemed to have decided on something and started talking.<br>
[I am a reader like you—]<br>
"I found you, Kim Dokja."<br>
A voice that flutters cold blood. Killer King was there, covered in bears' blood.<br>
Killer King spoke while aiming a bow gun filled with black magic power.<br>
"Get out of the way. I’ll kill that rat."<br>
[Heeeeeeeek!]<br>
The rat, startled, quickly hid behind me.<br>
I continued speaking while stopping Killer King.<br>
"Wait a minute, Killer King-ssi. This is—"<br>
"The 'Nail-Eating Rat'. He is from the zodiac."<br>
"I know that, but he—"<br>
"Possessed people like us."<br>
As if he already knew, Killer King did not withdraw his bowgun. An unusual anger was boiling all over his body.<br>
"This guy is the 'Misreading Association'."<br>
Misreading Association?<br>
"Have you already forgotten what happened at the Edge of Darkness?"<br>
I didn't forget. Of course I remembered it.<br>
The place where I first met the Killer King siblings. There, I fought against the incarnations sent by the constellations of the Misreading Association.<br>
The guy who sent those incarnations back then was also a 'rat'.<br>
[Oh, no. I am not a tyrant! Really!]<br>
"It's a lie. They know we can't use [Lie Detection] here, so they're deceiving us."<br>
[Because it’s not! It’s really unfair!]<br>
"I saw you exchanging indirect messages with the Misreading Association constellations in the past."<br>
At Killer King's words, the 'Nail-Eating Rat' once again rolled its eyes.<br>
[Oh, no. is it so. I did talk to them a bit! But really, I’m not from the Misreading Association!]<br>
"Questions and answers are useless. Die."<br>
[Eeeeeek!]<br>
The moment I thought about whether I should stop Killer King, the white-faced 'Nail-Eating Rat' crouched down and shouted.<br>
[Shit! It's ruined! The 'Misreading Association' you know is already ruined!]<br>
For the first time, Killer King stopped moving.<br>
"What does that mean?"<br>
[After all, there is no such thing as the 'Misreading Association' that you know! So, stop targeting us!]<br>
If you look at it that way, the constellations on the side of the 'Misreading Association' have not been visible at all recently.<br>
Killer King, who had been staring at the guy for a while, slowly lowered his bowgun.<br>
"Explain."<br>
The very excited 'Nail-Eating Rat' started saying things like "This is why I didn’t want to come" and then started crying and screaming.<br>
[I feel really unfair. I didn't really do anything! I'm not the one who moved the beastmen! I, I just want to let you guys know, how much I—]<br>
It was at that time that I heard a thump and a vibration echoing from somewhere.<br>
[How much, how much, ah, ah, ugh—]<br>
The 'Nail-Eating Rat' that was licking its lips suddenly started violently eating its own fingernails.<br>
[Oh, it’s coming. Come. He's coming. The guy is coming.]<br>
What?<br>
[Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.]<br>
The 'Nail-Eating Rat'’s eyes turned white and he soon collapsed.<br>
Killer King checked the guy’s pulse.<br>
"He’s not dead. But—"<br>
"Something is strange."<br>
The sound of weapons that filled the vacant lot until the end of the war could not be heard at all. The screams and shouts of the prisoners disappeared.<br>
Killer King and I ran toward the clearing.<br>
The prisoners waving their weapons at each other were still there.<br>
They all had their weapons laid down on the floor, their heads buried in the ground, and their palms turned toward the sky.<br>
As if they were worshiping their god.<br>
Even the 'bear that saves  pretend to be dead' was lying quietly on the floor as if he were dead.<br>
A disturbingly strange sight.<br>
"Kim Dokja."<br>
Killer King’s voice trembled.<br>
He was looking at the sky and pointed at something with his finger. A swirling portal was visible high in the sky.<br>
The portal to the upper floor was open.<br>
It was a portal that also appeared in 「The Three Little Pigs」. At that time, the symbolic body of the pig constellations came through that portal.<br>
So what happened this time?<br>
I heard someone approaching from behind.<br>
【Student .】<br>
Lycaon, who had always been in the lotus position while maintaining a small incarnation, returned to his original form.<br>
【Run away right now.】<br>
And then, from somewhere, I started hearing a story.<br>
「…"I won’t eat you."」<br>
A voice from a very old story.<br>
「...delicious.」<br>
I felt a chill as if someone had grabbed my heart.<br>
So far I have met several constellations. I fought against an Outer God, and even saw 'Ares', a narrative-grade constellation.<br>
So, deep down, I thought I wasn’t afraid of things like the Chinese Zodiac.<br>
However.<br>
「Give me a piece of rice cake.」<br>
The moment I saw the shadow of a huge constellation that seemed to be about a hundred meters tall, I cursed my poor imagination.<br>
Above the distant shadow that covered the ground, glowing red eyes were looking down at us.<br>
Is that really a <zodiac sign>?<br>
「I won’t eat you.」<br>
Its pattern burns like a flame.<br>
A story heard occasionally and intermittently.<br>
I thought I knew who this guy was.<br>
A slowly raised its head towards me.<br>
Sparks exploded violently in the air, and cold sweat formed on the back of my neck. I felt like my heart was being squeezed and blood was flowing from my nose.<br>
I knew it instinctively.<br>
「That is God.」<br>
There was a great-grade constellation that descended in a form close to its true body.<br>
But how?<br>
How was it possible for that constellation to descend to this place, where even the pig constellations had to come as symbols?<br>
It was impossible without a probable cause.<br>
「Probability justification.」<br>
I raised my head, biting my lip. The guy's eyes were right in front of my nose.<br>
"The Tiger Eating Rice Cake…"<br>
Only then did I realize.<br>
The reason he was able to come here.<br>
"Do you want to take me to the 'Zodiac Ball'?"<br>
It was because of me.

749 Episode 31 Yoo Jonghyuk (1)<br>
「The universe suddenly began one day. No one knows what happened before that.<br>
Perhaps that is why the 'Oldest Dream' must continue to dream.」<br>
—Lost guide<br>
*<br>
The group members expressed their admiration as they saw Yoo Jonghyuk step forward.<br>
Perhaps my companions also remembered 'that line'. Yoo Jonghyuk said a similar line when he killed Poseidon.<br>
"Oooooh!"<br>
"It sounds like something I’ve heard before."<br>
"As expected, it’s Yoo Jonghyuk."<br>
"Ah."<br>
"I can’t believe the day has come when I hear that in person."<br>
Dansu ahjussi, Kyung Sein, Killer King, Cha Yerin, and Ye Hyunwoo took turns spitting out a word and looking back at me at the same time.<br>
No one opened their mouths, but I could tell what everyone was curious about.<br>
"So is that real?"<br>
If you think about it with common sense, there is no way he could have killed a great-grade constellation twice in just 41 rounds.<br>
So that's why they're asking.<br>
I nodded slightly. That's real. Because this '41st round' is special.<br>
"Oooh!"<br>
As if she had received some sort of permission from my answer, Kyung Sein was excited and clapped her hands as she chanted his name.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk! Yoo Jonghyuk! Yoo Jonghyuk!"<br>
Dansu ahjussi also screamed in excitement.<br>
Killer King nodded and muttered quietly.<br>
"Go, Supreme King."<br>
Amid the noisy cheering, Yoo Jonghyuk glanced towards us.<br>
Seeing the line between his eyebrows, he must be in a bad mood.<br>
Well, I think it would be burdensome if he suddenly received support like that.<br>
Finally, his eyes turned to me. Afterwards, an [] was heard.<br>
—After I kill that guy, it’s your turn.<br>
Ugh, why?<br>
There was a memory that suddenly came to mind.<br>
「"Eat, you bastard!"」<br>
Could it be because of being fed dirt?<br>
But it's unfair.<br>
I have never fed dirt to this guy. I just fed them the 'story of eating dirt'.<br>
The guy who was controlled by the story picked up the dirt and ate it himself.<br>
Damn, this is why I was hoping his memories would come back late.<br>
Still, fortunately, it was a consolation to know that there was someone who would fall with me before me.<br>
[The constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' is wary of the incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk'.]<br>
It was an unexpected reaction.<br>
Under normal circumstances, this would have been an indignant moment, saying, "You’re going to kill me when you're just an incarnation?" or rushing in, shouting, "You bastard, how dare you!"<br>
[The constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' glares at the incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk' with a cautious expression.]<br>
He wasn't a 'reader' anymore.<br>
Nevertheless, being so wary of Yoo Jonghyuk means that the stories that control him are conscious of Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
There is a possibility that he may have read the 'reader’s' memories.<br>
[Could you have become a transcendental being?]<br>
Transcendent.<br>
The only mortal  that can fight against the immortal constellations in the <Star Stream>.<br>
However, as I remember, Yoo Jonghyuk has not yet transcended. If he had 'transcended', a system message would have already appeared.<br>
"I can defeat you even without transcendence."<br>
[A mortal who cannot even transcend would dare to face the constellations?]<br>
That's right, you should come out like that.<br>
Judging from the way he spoke, it seemed like the story 'old and sick guardian spirit' was active again.<br>
The more he behaves like a stereotypical constellation, the more likely he is to lose.<br>
[The constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' roars!]<br>
The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' is a great-grade constellation that utilizes some of the power of his true body.<br>
Although he was somewhat limited by probability, he was a more powerful being than the demon marquis he fought earlier.<br>
So this time, Yoo Jonghyuk also has to do his best.<br>
['Redemption of Truth' is activated.]<br>
Without hesitation, Yoo Jonghyuk activated 'Story Imprint'.<br>
[Part of incarnation Yoo Jonghyuk's memories are sealed.]<br>
Redemption of Truth is a 'story imprint' that unleashes power at the cost of sealing some of the memories of the previous rounds.<br>
Fragments of memories flowed into me as they  sealed before my eyes.<br>
「"Leader."」<br>
That is Yoo Jonghyuk's memory that was not written down in 'Ways of Survival' or 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint'.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk's 24th round.<br>
「"I have a favor to ask, Captain."」<br>
The scenery of the wide sea shimmered and waves waved before my eyes.<br>
Was it a scenario played out on the coast? Yoo Jonghyuk and Shin Yoosung were on the beach where the wreckage of broken ships washed up. The young girl had a large hole in her abdomen.<br>
「"I want to go back to school someday."」<br>
A wound that cannot be healed by either the 'Spirit of Elaine Forest' or the 'Great Hwandan'.<br>
The girl hid the wound with her  not to notice the wound.<br>
Shin Yoosung held her breath in Yoo Jonghyuk's arms.<br>
「"If this world ends safely—"」<br>
Shin Yoosung also knows.<br>
Schools will never reopen. Students will not return. She will never go to school.<br>
「"Please come to the graduation ceremony."」<br>
Even though she knew it all, Shin Yoosung had no choice but to say that.<br>
Even though she knew very well what kind of eternity it would be remembered by Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk now answers that eternal question.<br>
"I can’t go to your graduation ceremony, but—"<br>
His 24th attempt failed. The world has been destroyed and past history will never return.<br>
Shin Yoosung of the 24th round did not graduate.<br>
"I won’t let you die before me."<br>
His memories were being sealed.<br>
If it were the Yoo Jonghyuk I knew, he would never have sealed it. However, the more important memories are sealed, the more powerful the 'Redemption of Truth' is.<br>
Now, Yoo Jonghyuk needs a 'power' that strong.<br>
I stretched out my hand. I wanted to shout that those memories should not be sealed. If you forget that memory, the world will be as if it never happened.<br>
But at that moment, my eyes met with Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
"I."<br>
It may be an absurd leap.<br>
There's no way Yoo Jonghyuk in the 41 round would think like that.<br>
But now, Yoo Jonghyuk knew clearly that I was looking at his memories, and that I was the only one witnessing the memories he would lose.<br>
"I want you to remember this memory for me."<br>
I read and reread Yoo Jonghyuk's memories being sealed with my fists clenched. I remembered the disappearing Shin Yoosung and the 24th round without missing a single word.<br>
When I nodded, Yoo Jonghyuk turned his gaze.<br>
[All comprehensive abilities of incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk' temporarily exceed the scenario limit standards!]<br>
[Explosive power surges from your entire body!]<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk took a leap forward with a tremendous energy. Magical power was overflowing from the guy's whole body.<br>
Quad deud deuk!<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk's rushing sword strike collided with the front paws of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake'.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk lifted one seal from the Washington Dome and reached the same level as the 'Demon Marquis'.<br>
But this time, that level of force is not enough.<br>
[Just that much!]<br>
While listening to the constellation's planned message, Yoo Jonghyuk immediately opened the second narrative engraving.<br>
[Incarnation 'Yoo Jonhyuk' activates 'Restraint of Emotions'!]<br>
Restraint of Emotions.<br>
I'm nervous. This is because it reminded me of the 'black beast' that turned Washington Dome into hell.<br>
At that time, there was the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
However, if Yoo Jonghyuk's transformation into a beast progresses this time, who can stop him?<br>
—Do your part properly this time.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk's voice reached my ears.<br>
A little , I remembered my promise with him. The reason he wanted to take me to the Washington scenario.<br>
「"You stop it."」<br>
He trusted that I would get him back to normal when he had a problem.<br>
"I’ll try."<br>
A word I muttered without realizing it.<br>
Killer King glanced in my direction. Fortunately, Yoo Jonghyuk's transformation began before Killer King could even open his mouth.<br>
I watched his transformation with bated breath.<br>
Will he become a 'black beast' again this time, or...?<br>
[Incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk'’s story engraving skill has increased significantly.]<br>
['Restraint of Emotions' evolves!]<br>
With a dazzling beam of light, pitch-black hair covered Yoo Jonghyuk's entire body. But this time he was not the 'black beast'.<br>
The pitch-black hair grew in an instant, followed by a fur coat reminiscent of the [Beast Lord's sensitivity] used by 'Beast Lord' Shin Yoosung.<br>
The difference is that Yoo Jonghyuk's fur coat was black.<br>
Killer King, who was watching the scene from the side, widened his eyes.<br>
"Long hair, fur coat… Could it be the Emperor of Heilang?"<br>
Normally, I would have retorted to Killer King's nonsense, but this time, I was so overwhelmed by Yoo Jonghyuk's atmosphere that I couldn't think of anything else to say.<br>
Wearing a black fur coat, Yoo Jonghyuk really looked like a prince of the demon world who reigned over ten thousand horses.<br>
Maybe that is another form of the 'black beast'.<br>
[How—]<br>
While the story of the 'old and sick guardian deity' continued to lurk in secret, Yoo Jonghyuk’s new form moved.<br>
It's so fast that you can't even see it.<br>
Even after learning [Way of the Wind], it was a speed that I couldn't follow with my eyes.<br>
The astonished tiger screamed. However, neither the rushing spears nor the tiger's paws could catch Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
No story in this world could redeem Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
Pacheon kendo.<br>
A skill that has been trained and trained to reach its peak.<br>
In a sense, the 'Recycling Center' was his solo stage.<br>
All of his techniques have gone beyond the level of 'skill'. In other words, it is not restricted by skill seals.<br>
Pacheon yuseonggyeol.<br>
A meteor blossomed in the swordplay of 'Sain Tragedy Sword'. Stars cried out above every trace of the sword.<br>
"Gaaaaaagh!"<br>
The ghosts hit by the meteor fragments disappeared into light.<br>
Truly overwhelming force.<br>
The meteor shower pierced every part of the tiger’s body like a storm.<br>
[Kaaaaaa!]<br>
The constellation's scream spread throughout Zone 13.<br>
[The constellation 'Liverless Rabbit' opens its eyes in astonishment!]<br>
[The constellation 'Rat spreading plague’ is scared.]<br>
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' holds his breath.]<br>
The slowly moving front paw of the tiger. Yoo Jonghyuk did not miss the short gap and fired back and forth.<br>
The sword dug into the hole pierced by the meteor shower, connecting the holes like connecting constellations.<br>
With the sound of something breaking, the tiger's front paw flew through the air.<br>
[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' is overwhelmed by the power of the incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk'.]<br>
[The constellation 'The One Who Brought Ten Lambs' cannot take their eyes off incarnation 'Yoo Jonghyuk'.]<br>
I felt a thrill amidst the ecstatic tales scattered throughout.<br>
「A black wolf was hunting a tiger.」<br>
There was no human feeling in the graceful movement of the sword. What was reflected in the trajectory was simply the time of hardship endured by Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
Memories of training his sword day and night to defeat the constellations in the sky.<br>
[K, keaaaa—my arm! My arm—how dare you—!]<br>
All those memories were concentrated and summed up in a single body.<br>
He narrowed the distance with the gait of [Zuzakshinbo], blocked incoming blows with [Defense Strength], and dealt with the oncoming spear ghosts with [Hundred Step Godly Fists].<br>
And cut the constellation with [Pacheongeomdo].<br>
Pacheongwangwangmu.<br>
Dozens of sword lights pierced both legs of the tiger. One knee buckled, and then the other knee buckled again.<br>
The huge tiger's body lost its balance and fell forward. Yoo Jonghyuk didn't let go of the opportunity and flew towards the guy's neck.<br>
He was only on his eighth scenario.<br>
In the eighth scenario, Yoo Jonghyuk was trying to accomplish the feat of dropping a constellation from the sky with his own strength.<br>
[The story 'Old and Sick Guardian Deity' disappears.]<br>
[The story 'Rotten Dongajul' is activated in exchange for the 'Old and Sick Guardian Deity'!]<br>
「Rotten Dongajul」.<br>
The unique story of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' who escaped a desperate crisis.<br>
[The story 'Rotten Dongajul' begins its .]<br>
Although it was a similar technique to Nirvana's [No Possession], this story demanded a more terrible price than [No Possession].<br>
Just before Yoo Jonghyuk's sword touched the guy's neck, a bright red fireball burst out from the tiger's chest along with the sound of fu-chem. Red snowflakes were scattered on the ground, creating a red sorghum field.<br>
The image of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' began to disperse like smoke among the blood-stained sorghum fields.<br>
[I am dissatisfied. Since I was unable to get the little one—]<br>
The mantra of the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' rang out as if he were sorrowful.<br>
His gaze full of hatred that had been on me soon turned to someone else.<br>
[I will take the other one.]

752 Episode 31 Yoo Jonghyuk (4)<br>
After 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' left, a message was released.<br>
[Due to the scenario's direct change, the start date of the 'Zodiac Ball' is adjusted.]<br>
[The 'Zodiac Ball' will begin in 12 hours.]<br>
[Currently, 71% of the prisoners in Zone 13  you.]<br>
[To participate in the 'Zodiac Ball' you must secure an additional 9%.]<br>
In the process of fighting the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake', our approval rating actually rose despite the fact that a huge number of prisoners died.<br>
"I never thought there would be an incarnation that could stand against the <Zodiac>…"<br>
Someone had expectations of us.<br>
"Zone 13 is in the spotlight because of you guys."<br>
Someone criticized us.<br>
"I think it would be a good idea to leave Zone 13 at this point."<br>
Some people advised us to give up on Zone 13.<br>
He was the crane owner in 「The Fox and the Crane」.<br>
"I would welcome any of the zodiac signs. I have never seen such an outstanding incarnation at Zone 13 of the 'Recycling Center'."<br>
According to the system, the story of exterminating the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' was widely known throughout Star Stream through the center director.<br>
[Your new tale spreads widely throughout the <Star Stream>.]<br>
[Some constellations were greatly impressed by your story.]<br>
[18,000 coins were donated through the 'Recycling Center'.]<br>
As evidence, messages were still being delivered in real time.<br>
[A few nebulae want you to join them.]<br>
[The nebula <Hongik> invites you.]<br>
[The nebula <Tamra> invites you.]<br>
[The nebula <Samyo> invites you.]<br>
…<br>
The small and medium-sized nebulae that were being pushed out by the large nebulae sent me messages to do business with me.<br>
Among them, there were even <Hongik> and <Tam>, the nebulae of the Korean Peninsula.<br>
I was curious because it was nebulae that did not appear properly in the main story, but I had no intention of choosing them here.<br>
This was because we were still trapped in the 'Recycling Center' and the scenario related to the <Zodiac> was still in progress.<br>
[The faction 'Monkey God' invites you to the 'Zodiac Ball'.]<br>
[The faction 'Dragon God' invites you to the 'Zodiac Ball'.]<br>
Some factions of the Zodiac also sent invitations to me, as if word had spread that I had declined the tiger's invitation.<br>
"I have no intention of entering <Zodiac>.»<br>
But I didn't come this far just to join that animal union.<br>
"I will attend the 'Zodiac Ball' without anyone’s sponsorship."<br>
I needed the support of eighty percent of the prisoners.<br>
And that was the reason why I was now meeting the crane owner.<br>
"Many prisoners, including me, are already supporting you."<br>
The crane owner, who already knew my situation, sighed lightly and continued.<br>
"But there has never been a representative whose approval rating exceeded 80% in Zone 13."<br>
"Just because it’s never happened doesn’t mean it’s impossible."<br>
"Now the only ones left are the bears and some other beastmen. But it will be difficult to gain their support."<br>
The prisoners nearby are all supporting me. The only exceptions were the bears that followed the Tiger, and their subordinate forces.<br>
But no matter what I did, I could not persuade them.<br>
"Because they don’t have any stories left that you can repair."<br>
The prisoners who we were able to persuade all had 'forgotten stories'.<br>
We revived those stories through 「Staging」and spread them through the <Star Stream>.<br>
The prisoners supported us in return. But in the case of the bear beastmen, that was impossible.<br>
"Is there no way?"<br>
"Honestly, there is none. Wouldn’t it be great if you were a constellation like the 'Master of Fables'? Isn’t it impossible to give individual stories to all of them?"<br>
If it's the owner of fables, you're probably referring to the constellation that wrote 'Aesop's Fables'.<br>
"That’s right. We don’t have enough time."<br>
"They are not people who can listen by simply threatening them with force. In particular, the 'bear that will spare you if you pretend to be dead' is a constellation with strong pride.<br>
He looked down at Yoo Jonghyuk, who was sleeping soundly on the bed, and added:<br>
"Perhaps there is a 'story' that can sweep them all away at once. Can you help me with this?"<br>
I helped the crane ownerYoo Jonghyuk up from his sleep and fed him some soup. It was a special soup with the story of 「The Fox and the Crane」.<br>
He's the kind of guy who never eats food made by someone else, so I was glad he was unconscious right now.<br>
After feeding him some soup, Yoo Jonghyuk's pale complexion became a little more lively.<br>
The crane owner sighed lightly and said.<br>
"Anyway, this guy got smaller again, but I was really scared when he cut down the<br>
"I’m glad he's smaller."<br>
"Anyway, take care of him. I’ll come again."<br>
With those last words, the crane owner left the room.<br>
I took a few bites of the soup the owner left behind and looked at Yoo Jonghyuk who was sleeping for a moment.<br>
After that incident three days ago, Yoo Jonghyuk had been sleeping ever since.<br>
Perhaps due to the side effects of [Story Engraving], Yoo Jonghyuk became little Yoo Jonghyuk again.<br>
He wasn't as small as the little Yoo Jonghyuk I saw in the snowfield, but he would probably be like this for a while anyway.<br>
The 41st round was the last round for Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
He transmitted his experience to his past self through Shin Yoosung and exited the record of 'Ways of Survival'.<br>
I repeat, no one knows what happened to that guy after he left.<br>
Has he stopped regressing in some way, or has he disappeared forever from his records in some way I don't know?<br>
If he had disappeared from his records, would he have finally achieved his wish?<br>
"Don’t worry too much."<br>
I muttered as I covered the sleeping little boy, Yoo Jonghyuk, with a blanket.<br>
"Because this round won’t be ruined so easily."<br>
The person who starts a story has a responsibility not to give up on it.<br>
I made a promise to Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' responds to your oath.]<br>
This story may not be 『Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World』 or 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』, but it will definitely have the right ending.<br>
Now it was time to go see the end of this round for that conclusion.<br>
*<br>
An hour later, I gathered together the bear beastmen and the beastmen who had not expressed support.<br>
The guys seemed taken aback or confused by my sudden call.<br>
Some even reacted.<br>
[Why did you call us?]<br>
Their representative was the constellation that invaded this place—'the bear that will spare you if you pretend to be dead'.<br>
[If you're calling us to support you, you'd better give up.]<br>
"Why?"<br>
[Because we have no intention of supporting you.]<br>
"So why?"<br>
[There is no reason to explain that.]<br>
"Of course you will.<br>
I squatted down in my seat and let out a deep sigh. Then I looked up at the guys.<br>
"But you… is it okay for you to continue like that?"<br>
No matter what I say, they won't be persuaded by me.<br>
The reason is obvious.<br>
Because they don't need my help.<br>
What should we do for those who have lost their stories?<br>
Maybe I've been thinking about this problem for quite some time.<br>
Some extras found their own stories on their own. Like Bang Cheolsoo from Geumho Station. Like the mother and daughter. Like the crane owner.<br>
But not everyone could do it like they did.<br>
Some people find their own stories, but others live and die without even knowing what their stories are.<br>
For example, like the bears in front of me right now.<br>
"Honestly, it doesn’t really matter whether you support me or not. I can rise to the top somehow."<br>
[Then why did you call us?]<br>
"To give you one last chance."<br>
I know that not everyone can purely support me.<br>
Kim Dokja also knew that.<br>
No matter what he did, some constellations hated Kim Dokja's story.<br>
Kim Dokja pioneered his life by fighting against that gaze, and eventually it also became his story.<br>
But it wasn't easy for me to accept it.<br>
Maybe it's because I'm a 'writer'.<br>
I wanted to write a perfect story that Kim Dokja had never read and that he didn't know about.<br>
[The story 'Recorder of Things That Will Disappear' responds to your emotions.]<br>
But it was impossible.<br>
I finally realized it as I went through Geumho Station, Chungmuro, the Theater Dungeon, Gwanghwamun, Washington Dome, and the Recycling Center.<br>
There is no story that all the constellations in the world love.<br>
Even more so if it is the story of the 'forgotten round'.<br>
So I accepted.<br>
It's okay even if not all prisoners support me. It's safe to say that they hate the stories I'm going to write.<br>
"This is truly your last chance. Your chance to choose me by yourself."<br>
But I just write stories.<br>
[What does that mean?]<br>
"I don’t think there’s any reason to explain what it means."<br>
[The constellation 'the bear that spares pretend to be dead' is outraged!]<br>
Even a constellation that has lost all of its status still has pride.<br>
[How dare a mere incarnation carry beastmen on its back—!]<br>
But he misjudged.<br>
"It’s not just an incarnation."<br>
I grinned and looked at him.<br>
Until a few days ago, its power was threatening. I thought that  would be a difficult enemy to defeat if I did not use 『Staging』.<br>
However.<br>
"Has your eyesight deteriorated and you’ve forgotten how to read stories?"<br>
His status no longer seemed great to me.<br>
I slowly stood up.<br>
[You are currently acting as the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]<br>
[The status of the constellation 'Demon King of Salvation' rests fully upon you.]<br>
As my entire body radiated the majestic energy of stories, bright light began to flow from my incarnation body.<br>
Some of the prisoners who noticed it were frightened and bowed their heads.<br>
"Stand, the constellation…!"<br>
Even the 'bear that will spare  if  pretend to be dead' was looking at me with shocked eyes.<br>
As I lightly placed my hand on the guy's shoulder, his knees slowly began to buckle.<br>
The guy shouted as if he was struggling.<br>
[No matter what you do, it’s useless. We will never do your favor—]<br>
"Oh, did that sound like a request?"<br>
A way to persuade those who have lost their stories, lost their memories, and ultimately lost the ability to read.<br>
"I’ll tell you again. You only have one choice."<br>
The crane owner said. Those who have lost their own stories are just being swept away by other 'stories' like a torrent.<br>
So the only way to persuade them is through 'stories'.<br>
[The story begins 'Incite'.]<br>
So, the method I would choose was decided.<br>
[Support me.]<br>
It becomes the story of 'I will sweep them all away'.<br>
[It must be scary to jump into the scenarios again. I know. That's why I'm saying it.]<br>
I saw the confused beastmen looking up at me one by one. A faint trace of emotion passed through their dead eyes.<br>
[At least as long as you support me, I will be your 'story'. I will fight on your behalf and become a laughingstock for the constellations on your behalf.]<br>
My persuasion was not persuasion.<br>
My words will not be heard in their ears. They are simply overwhelmed by my story and crushed by the status of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
So their choice now is,<br>
[Just support me. Then at least you will be able to see the end of this world through me.]<br>
In fact, it wasn't a choice.<br>
[Your approval rating begins to rise.]<br>
[Your approval rating has reached a certain level.]<br>
[Currently, 83% of prisoners in Zone 13 support you.]<br>
It was an easy and clear ending.<br>
[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is scolding you for not doing this sooner.]<br>
[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' says that sometimes a decision like that of an 'adventurer who laid an egg' is needed.]<br>
[The constellation 'The One Who Brought Ten Lambs' looks at you sadly.]<br>
And as always, clear cider,<br>
[The constellation 'the bear that spares pretend to be dead' rejects your instigation.]<br>
[The constellation 'the bear that comes back to life if you pretend to be dead' loses his story and chooses to disappear.]<br>
The aftertaste was bitter.<br>
[You have obtained permission to attend the 'Zodiac Ball'.]

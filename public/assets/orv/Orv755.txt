755 Episode 32 Monkey King (2)<br>
There are a total of four 'Sun Wukong' in the <Star Stream>.<br>
'Sun Wukong' is divided into a total of four depending on the modifier he has.<br>
The first one was '' who was the monkey king of Mt. Hwagwa Mountain.<br>
The second is '', who was the stable keeper of the heavenly world.<br>
The third is '', whom we know (this guy is the owner of the golden headband).<br>
The fourth is '', who attained enlightenment at the end of his journey and became Buddha.<br>
Looking at it this way, I felt that he was somehow similar to Kim Dokja. Because Kim Dokja’s existence was divided according to his modifier.<br>
[I asked, are you Kim Dokja?]<br>
"First of all, I am Kim Dokja."<br>
I continued speaking while looking closely at the monkey in front of me.<br>
「Dazzling golden fur. Tattered tiger skin panties. Even his unique eyes that look somewhat drowsy.」<br>
It was definitely true. The monkey in front of me is—<br>
"Are you ?"<br>
[This guy. It's quite surprising that you recognize me.]<br>
snorted, placed his hands on his waist and looked triumphant.<br>
Anyway, is a narrative-grade constellation that represents the birth of 'Sun Wukong'. According to Kim Dokja, it was the constellation equivalent of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
However… What is this?<br>
The impact felt by  was not large. At first, I thought it was because I was getting stronger, but I didn't think that was the case.<br>
Is he hiding his true power?<br>
That may be so. Because all Sun Wukongs are good at adjusting the level of the story.<br>
But even so, is it possible for , a narrative-grade constellation, to appear here in an incarnation body?<br>
I don't know.<br>
Since everything that happens these days completely ignores probability, I now doubt whether probability even exists in this world.<br>
[Is that how you see it?]<br>
I guess I was staring too hard.<br>
King Mifu said while scratching his golden hair.<br>
[Is this guy also in love with my fur? Well, even the  guy is jealous of my fur. He is a man with eyes to see.]<br>
When he says , he probably means .<br>
chuckled and said with his deep eyes flashing.<br>
[You probably know why I came.]<br>
"I can guess."<br>
Just a few hours ago, I received a message from the 'Monkey' faction saying they were recruiting me.<br>
And the  before my eyes was the famous 'Monkey King'.<br>
[The faction 'Monkey God' invites you.]<br>
In other words,  is the master of the 'Monkey God' faction.<br>
It's not another monkey, it's .. The scale of the 'Zodiac Ball'  be bigger than I thought.<br>
[Hmm. Even though I came in person, the response was only that much?]<br>
When I saw  disapproving expression, I thought it was a pity. I should have asked to take a picture together.<br>
[Insolent bastard, come join my forces.]<br>
, like Sun Wukong, didn't even listen to my answer and just kept talking.<br>
[I liked your story. I allow you to become my incarnation.]<br>
To be honest, it would be a lie if I said there wasn't a part that tempted me.<br>
He is the incarnation body of .<br>
If I wasn't the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation', I might have been quite attracted to it.<br>
If I can persuade  to succeed in the '4-stage union of Sun Wukong' and then evolve him into 'The Liberator', I will have the strongest mythical constellation in history as my sponsor.<br>
Of course, it was a wrong assumption at this point.<br>
"I’m sorry, but I already have a constellation—"<br>
[Hmph, I already know that your idiot sponsor is away. Are you ignoring me?]<br>
"Even if he is away, once you are behind, you are always behind."<br>
It wasn't even in my mind, but Kim Dokja would have said this. As expected,  reaction was not bad.<br>
[This guy is more loyal than I thought. I like it.]<br>
"Thank you for your understanding."<br>
[If that’s the case, I will directly order 'cancellation of the constellation contract'.]<br>
"Yes?"<br>
It occurred to me later that I had made a mistake.  is Sun Wukong, who has the most eccentric personality among his brothers. He was a 'King of ' who did whatever he wanted to do.<br>
Just as I was wondering what kind of incredible lie I had to tell to avoid this situation—<br>
A skein of shining golden thread flew from somewhere.<br>
The skein of thread wrapped exactly around  head. The sound of an order was heard afterwards. , who was holding his head, let out an undignified scream.<br>
[Ngegegegegegegegye—]<br>
[The story 'Monkey Seal' begins its storytelling.]<br>
It's a story about overpowering ''.<br>
[Okay! I knew!]<br>
With a 'pop' sound,  turned into a small monkey. , who was glaring at me disapprovingly, did a somersault, jumped backwards sharply, and climbed on top of a woman.<br>
The woman smiled bitterly at , who shouted "Ukkkkkkk."<br>
"I told you not to do that, right?"<br>
A unique, clear voice that reassures people.<br>
I often thought,<br>
If Yoo Sangah existed in reality, she might have been that person.<br>
Another person in this world who calls me 'writer'.<br>
"Have you written any side stories in the meantime, author?"<br>
Editor Ji Eunyu was there.<br>
*<br>
Ji Eunyu  during the fierce battle at the Washington Dome. At that time, she had neither the time nor the presence of mind to say hello.<br>
On one side, the Demon King of Salvation was dying, and on the other side, Yoo Jonghyuk, who had become a black beast, was running rampant.<br>
[The constellation '' looks at you with disapproving eyes.]<br>
Fortunately, there was only one monkey running wild right now, and even that monkey had calmed down in Ji Eunyu's arms.<br>
Perhaps it was because she had subdued , but it seemed as if a halo could be seen behind Ji Eunyu's back.<br>
"Your spirit has turned white."<br>
" author looks like you’re having a hard time."<br>
"Is it noticeable even though I’m wearing a mask?"<br>
"Yes, I can see it."<br>
We exchanged casual greetings and smiled at each other.<br>
There is a unique feeling of relief when I am with Ji Eunyu. I feel like it's okay even if I make mistakes.<br>
My editor not only finds spelling and spacing, but also finds sentences I forgot to write.<br>
She could tell whether I was confident in my writing by reading just a few sentences of the manuscript.<br>
"It’s noticeable."<br>
That's what Ji Eunyu said when I asked her how she knew.<br>
"Editor. I have a lot to ask. Especially…"<br>
Ji Eunyu noticed my sidelong glance at and cleared her throat slightly.<br>
"Have you forgotten who my sponsor is?"<br>
A bit late, a series of information came to mind.<br>
As far as I know, the constellation that Ji Eunyu signed a contract with was 'Lotus Flower Blooming Under the Moonlight'— 'Yoo Sangah, the Emp of ', a member of <Kim Dokja Company>.<br>
"I chose 'Monkey' among the zodiac signs. I thought that would be the easiest to conquer."<br>
In the story, Yoo Sangah goes through the 'Island of the Reincarnated' and is resurrected through the incarnation of .<br>
In fact, most of the '' and related skills used by Yoo Sangah are borrowed from  tale.<br>
The metaphor is a judgment.<br>
"If I go to the 'Monkey' faction, I can use my sponsor’s story."<br>
I was secretly impressed.<br>
"But the monkey force could have been without Sun Wukong."<br>
"This is the 'Recycling Center'. I thought Sun Wukong would definitely be there. Instead, it’s the somewhat unpopular Sun Wukong."<br>
Indeed, the power of reasoning to find even unwritten sentences.<br>
[The constellation '' is complaining that he is ignored again!]<br>
Ji Eunyu gently scratched chin and continued her words.<br>
"And when I got to the monkey area, there was this big cave. I was immediately convinced."<br>
"Huagua Mountain Convergence Cave."<br>
"Yes, there was this person there."<br>
Who would have guessed that the 'monkey area' of the Chinese zodiac was the birthplace of ?<br>
It was undoubtedly an excellent place for<br>
'recycling'.<br>
" author didn’t choose any faction, right?"<br>
"Yes."<br>
"I knew you would. Because you’re the type of person who only takes the hardest path."<br>
"It really wasn’t easy this time."<br>
"Still, you definitely feel different than before. Your back seems to have straightened a bit."<br>
"Is that so?"<br>
I looked down at my body again. Now that I think about it, I feel like my body has improved a little.<br>
"I understand that you went around having fun without writing what you were told to write."<br>
Although I heard some nagging, meeting Ji Eunyu here was a blessing.<br>
From the looks of it,  doesn't seem to have any particular hostility towards us.<br>
[Level 2 of the exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated.]<br>
It was then that I suddenly heard a skill activation message.<br>
[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] has never been activated in this way, so maybe it's the influence of the 'Constellation Act'.<br>
I could hear someone's inner thoughts in my head.<br>
「Who is it.」<br>
I immediately knew whose thoughts those were. This person doesn't use question marks even when thinking.<br>
「She called him writer.」<br>
"By the way, I’m late for the introduction. Editor, this is Cha Yerin. Yerin, this is my editor."<br>
But this time, I heard the other side’s inner thoughts.<br>
「Writer, is it okay to say that?」<br>
There were a little too many 'inner feelings'.<br>
「Did he reveal that he was a writer?」<br>
「Then it’ll be a little bit difficult, right?」<br>
Yes. therefore.<br>
「If it’s someone he can trust, it’ll be okay.」<br>
「But Kim Dokja didn’t reveal his identity until much later.」<br>
Let me explain.<br>
「What if that person betrays us?」<br>
「I think we need to come up with a separate response plan.」<br>
「As a first measure—」<br>
I quickly intervened before Ji Eunyu’s plan of action could progress any further.<br>
"Editor, this person is my reader. You can rest assured."<br>
"Ah."<br>
"I revealed my secret. She is my only reader."<br>
"The only… reader?"<br>
I happened to express it that way, but it wasn't wrong.<br>
Cha Yerin is probably the only person who read and remembers my debut work.<br>
「Then what about me?」<br>
Eh?<br>
"Nice to meet you. I’m Ji Eunyu. I’m the person who reads and edits the author’s writing before anyone else."<br>
Only then did I suddenly come to my senses.<br>
Come to think of it, Cha Yerin wasn't the only one. Although she may not have read my debut novel, Ji Eunyu was a reader who read my novels before anyone else and read them more.<br>
"I’m Cha Yerin. I’ve read all of his novels."<br>
Ji Eunyu's expression changed completely after hearing Cha Yerin's introduction.<br>
"You’ve read all of the author’s novels?"<br>
"Yes."<br>
"Even the Genesis trilogy?"<br>
"Yes."<br>
"You’re a complete Kim Dokja."<br>
"Kim Dokja…"<br>
Cha Yerin awkwardly looked down at her toes.<br>
Now I understand. That's an  expression.<br>
"What path did you take when reading the book?"<br>
"I read it in paperback first, but I bought it all later. The serial version, the copy, and—"<br>
"Wow! Thank you so much! What are you doing, writer? You need to thank her quickly."<br>
"Thank you."<br>
I suddenly said thanks to her.<br>
"Bigger! She’s the one who saved our management from almost being ruined!"<br>
"Thank you!"<br>
"If you need an autographed copy, please let me know anytime! I don’t have the book right now, but—"<br>
When I thought about it, this was Ji Eunyu’s true self. I was worried for no reason.<br>
[The constellation '' yawns, saying he doesn’t know what you are talking about.]<br>
[The constellation '' urges you to proceed with the scenario quickly.]<br>
"Look at that. Come to think of it, this wasn’t the time."<br>
"Yes, well. Let’s leave our greetings like this."<br>
"Do you know where this place is?"<br>
In response to Ji Eunyu’s question, I looked around at the surrounding scenery.<br>
"Yes. I know."<br>
A landscape covered in clouds everywhere.<br>
「This is the place where Kim Dokja waited for the carriage during the 'Constellation Banquet'.」<br>
The name of this place is 'Cloud Road'.<br>
A place that serves as a tributary and station connecting the scenarios of the <Star Stream>. That means,<br>
"The carriage will be here soon."<br>
As if to prove my thoughts, I saw something like a small dot flying from afar in the sky. The dot grew bigger little by little, and as expected, it took on the shape of a carriage.<br>
Cha Yerin said with admiration.<br>
"A carriage like that came during the constellation banquet."<br>
At that time, it was Apollo's golden chariot.<br>
The carriage coming this time was also a luxurious golden carriage.<br>
The difference was that this time it was the little rats that were pulling the carriage.<br>
[The constellation '' is complaining that the organizers have used their coins in the wrong place again.]<br>
A golden carriage at the 'Recycling Center'. Perhaps in which scenario was that used first?<br>
[New sub-scenario has arrived!]<br>
+<br>
<Sub Scenario - Orient Express Wagon><br>
Category: Sub<br>
Difficulty: S++<br>
Clear conditions: Get on the carriage. Arrive at your destination safely.<br>
Time limit: 2 hours<br>
Reward: 'Zodiac Ball' admission ticket.<br>
Failure: Death.<br>
+<br>
On the outside, it was such a peaceful scenario that one wondered if this could even be a scenario. But.<br>
"Is this it?"<br>
Ji Eunyu asked.<br>
"That’s it."<br>
I answered.<br>
As any aspiring Killer King knows, the carriage Kim Dokja is riding in in the 'Constellations' Banquet' is attacked by constellations and crashes.<br>
The mere fact that 'riding on a carriage' came up as a scenario means that this carriage will inevitably suffer the same fate.<br>
Above all, the meaningful sentence 'arrive at your destination safely' proved this.<br>
I smiled bitterly and opened my mouth.<br>
"There is no way to get over this easily."<br>
"Who can I blame?"<br>
"Yes?"<br>
"I told you when I was serializing. Sometimes you need an easy scenario so readers can take a break."<br>
I didn't know it would come back to me like this either.<br>
"I was wrong."<br>
Even the difficulty level of the sub-scenario is S++.<br>
At this point, I suspect that the 'Recycling Center’s Director' may also be a possessed person.<br>
A carriage that strangely resembled Apollo's golden carriage finally stopped in front of me. The squeaking rats lowered their heads as if to say hello.<br>
The moment I put my hand on the carriage door handle to board, a message came out.<br>
[Only designated incarnations can ride this carriage.]<br>
[Story fragment 'Facial Recognition' is activated.]<br>
It’s a carriage with a 'face recognition' function.<br>
Was it by any chance made in <Emperor>?<br>
Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin, who completed facial recognition, boarded in turn, followed by my turn.<br>
[Face recognition failed.]<br>
I thought it was broken, but when I thought about it, I was still wearing the mask. It's not even a metaphor for  carriage, so no one would recognize me wearing a mask.<br>
Now that the Zone 13 scenario was over, there was no reason to insist on masking any longer.<br>
[Release the 'mask'.]<br>
As I took off my mask for the first time in a while, the stuffy feeling disappeared and cool air enveloped my face.<br>
I relaxed my neck for a moment and lightly rolled my shoulders, but my face felt strangely hot.<br>
When I looked up, Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin were looking at me with surprised eyes.<br>
[The constellation  is looking at you blankly.]<br>
The same was true for , who was sitting on Ji Eunyu’s head.<br>
What followed was ’s voice heard in my ears.<br>
[This guy. That’s interesting.]<br>
My face was reflected in the carriage window that slowly opened.<br>
I stared at this face for a long time, even forgetting that I had to get on the carriage.<br>
The person I possessed was clearly Cheon Inho. However,<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' smiles with satisfaction as he looks at you.]<br>
Reflected in the window, I was wearing Kim Dokja’s face.

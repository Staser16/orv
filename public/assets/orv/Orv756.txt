756 Episode 32 Monkey King (3)<br>
The scenery of the cloud road flowed outside the window.<br>
Someday, Kim Dokja must have seen the same scene. What was Kim Dokja thinking as he passed this road?<br>
I don't know.<br>
At that time, Kim Dokja was riding with the symbol of Dionysus.<br>
Maybe he was too busy wondering whether the wine in Dionysus's cup was real.<br>
The two didn't ask why I had Kim Dokja's face.<br>
Just as Kim Dokja did not ask whether the wine in Dionysus's cup was his urine or not.<br>
All I hear in my ears is the squeak of rats running on the cloud road and the sound of the wind blowing gently.<br>
As I slowly took my eyes off the window, I made eye contact with Cha Yerin.<br>
"Are you okay?"<br>
I nodded and answered.<br>
"I'm okay."<br>
"But it’s Kim Dokja's face."<br>
The reason she immediately recognized this face was probably because it resembled Kim Dokja, who appeared on the cover of the original novel.<br>
"Yes. This is Kim Dokja’s face."<br>
I felt like it was a stupid conversation, but I had no other way to respond. Because I really had Kim Dokja’s face.<br>
"He’s more handsome than I thought."<br>
"Yes?"<br>
"His assumption was correct."<br>
"Kill… what did Seongwoo-ssi say?"<br>
"Kim Dokja is not 'ugly' but 'ugly'."<br>
I belatedly remembered the nickname given to Kim Dokja.<br>
'The Ugliest King.'<br>
If you think about it, the first title Kim Dokja received was not 'Demon King of Salvation' but 'The Ugliest King'.<br>
Ji Eunyu, who was listening to the story nearby, asked.<br>
"What does that mean?"<br>
"Ugly is just being ugly, but 'ugly' means not ."<br>
"Aha."<br>
It was a pretty subtle difference.<br>
Of course, from my point of view as the person who wrote that expression, I wonder what the specific intention was...<br>
As if reading my thoughts, Ji Eunyu answered.<br>
"But I don’t think there was any particular intention—"<br>
"What are you talking about, editor? It was all perfectly intentional. Above all, Kim Dokja was blocked from external perception by the [Fourth Wall]! Other people couldn’t see Kim Dokja’s face properly!"<br>
After hearing my explanation, Cha Yerin shook her head in admiration.<br>
"But even though there is a [Fourth Wall], I can still see the author’s face."<br>
"Well, I don’t have the [Fourth Wall]…"<br>
As I spoke up to that point, I stopped.<br>
Now I am the representative of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
Even though the [Fourth Wall] was activated, there was nothing strange about it at all.<br>
"Open up, Fourth Wall."<br>
There was no particular [Fourth Wall] response to my command.<br>
Ji Eunyu asked in a suspicious voice.<br>
"If you do that, it will open?"<br>
"I just gave it a try. But can you see my face clearly now?"<br>
"Yes. What about Yerin-ssi?"<br>
"It looks good."<br>
Does this mean that the [Fourth Wall] is not working properly?<br>
[The attributes' window cannot be activated due to a current system error.]<br>
However, the 'attributes' window' is still not visible.<br>
Ji Eunyu, who was quietly observing my face, continued speaking.<br>
"Yerin-ssi, you said that the author looks like Kim Dokja right now, right?"<br>
"Yes."<br>
"It’s a little surprising. It doesn’t look that way to me."<br>
I asked, wondering what this was all about.<br>
"So how do you see it?"<br>
"It just looks like the original author’s face."<br>
"My face?"<br>
"It’s not exact, but I think so. , didn’t you always look like this? Your hair style is very different, but…"<br>
There was a question that immediately came to mind.<br>
「What did I originally look like?」<br>
Has it been too long since I possessed a character? Even when I saw my face reflected in the window and touched it again, my old face did not come to mind.<br>
It feels like my face has been like this from the beginning.<br>
I felt scared for a moment because of that sentiment, which did not feel the slightest sense of discomfort.<br>
[The 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is looking at you.]<br>
I couldn't tell these two people.<br>
The 'story' I have is said to be eating up 'Kim Dokja’s fragments', and to the extent that I have eaten those fragments, I am becoming more like Kim Dokja.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' opens its eyes greedily.]<br>
Even now, my story is coveting the two people in front of me.<br>
「If you touch either of them, I will never speak of you again.」<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' frowns and steps away.]<br>
Fortunately, the story quickly quieted down.<br>
However, in that short period of time, there were people who witnessed the altercation between me and my story.<br>
[I never thought there would be someone who like us in this universe.]<br>
It was .  delivered his mantra in the form of a telephonic voice so that the other two could not hear it.<br>
[When one being becomes many, problems arise. Get your mind straight. If you don’t want to be preyed upon by 'just one story'.]<br>
Just one story.<br>
I didn't expect to hear these words here, so I suddenly looked at him. However,  seemed to have no intention of saying more, and he yawned repeatedly, hiding his bored expression.<br>
[Wake me up when you arrive.]<br>
soon took a deep breath and fell asleep in Ji Eunyu's arms.<br>
And as soon as he fell asleep, a small display appeared above the carriage window.<br>
[Welcome aboard the 'Orient Express Wagon'.]<br>
I thought it was just a golden carriage, but the internal facilities are state-of-the-art. Well, I should have looked into it from the moment the fragment of the 「fingerprint recognition」 story was attached.<br>
The carriage traveling on the cloudy road felt like it was tilting for a moment.<br>
[After a while, the carriage changes to 'manual operation'.]<br>
No, suddenly?<br>
As soon as the message ended, a controller appeared out of thin air. It was the same controller we commonly use when playing games.<br>
['Zodiac Ball' participants must operate the 'controller' to drive the carriage themselves.]<br>
[The destination is displayed on the panel.]<br>
[You may attack or be attacked by another carriage on the way to your destination.]<br>
[Special prizes will be awarded to the passengers of the carriage that reach the destination in first place.]<br>
At the same time, a huge panel appears before my eyes. There was a dot on the panel marking the location of our carriage.<br>
In addition to us, what appeared to be carriages were moving nearby.<br>
Maybe there's a carriage with Killer King or Lee Dansu among them.<br>
[After 30 seconds, 'manual driving' will begins.]<br>
30 seconds. There isn't much time.<br>
I quickly looked back at Ji Eunyu and opened my mouth.<br>
"Editor-nim."<br>
"Yes. Are you asking me to knock you out?"<br>
I don't know how Ji Eunyu knew, but she was already pulling out a large hammer from her pocket.<br>
Cha Yerin also said, clashing her iron fists together.<br>
"If it’s about knocking someone out, I’m good at it."<br>
I looked at them for a moment and then answered.<br>
"I’ll just do it myself."<br>
I was lucky that this wasn't 'Zone 13'.<br>
"I’m going to pass out for 30 seconds from now."<br>
[This area is a place where 'skill' use is permitted.]<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv. 10' is activated!]<br>
[Your understanding of the story fragment 'Incite' is very excellent.]<br>
[The story fragment 'Incite' has a great influence on the proficiency of skill 'Incite'.]<br>
With the feeling of my consciousness sinking, I activated [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint].<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage 2 is activated!]<br>
Let's see.<br>
Let’s check Yoo Jonghyuk’s side first.<br>
As I thought of Yoo Jonghyuk, the boy from the 41st round, in my head, the inside of another carriage appeared before my eyes.<br>
「" must be in a carriage too."」<br>
The conditions for activating the skill have been met. It seems he also thought of me.<br>
And the one who rode with Yoo Jonghyuk—<br>
「'If you say that guy, do you mean Kim Dokja?"」<br>
Damn it, why is it Killer King?<br>
The boy Yoo Jonghyuk and Killer King were staring at each other while sitting across from each other in the carriage.<br>
「"Why do you call Kim Dokja 'that guy'?"」<br>
「"It my heart."」<br>
「"Only close friends use that title. You and Kim Dokja are not close. It's actually me who is close."」<br>
「"You don't seem that close either."」<br>
The two growled as if they were going to fight at any moment, and then looked at the controller that appeared in the air and spoke at the same time.<br>
「"I'll do it."」<br>
I immediately switched the screen.<br>
It would have been a lie if I said we weren't there, but after thinking about it, I thought there wouldn't be that much of a problem if these two were a team.<br>
That's because Yoo Jonghyuk's characteristic was that he was a pro gamer, and Killer King was also talented at games.<br>
The problem was with the other team.<br>
「"Aaaah! Dokja-ssi, what should I do? What should I do!"」<br>
Kyung Sein was already calling my name.<br>
Next, the sacrific face of Lee Dansu appeared before my eyes.<br>
As expected, Kyung Sein and Dansu ahjussi were on the same team.<br>
I used [group chat] to talk to them.<br>
—<br>
Then, Dansu ahjussi and Kyung Sein looked up into the sky at the same time.<br>
「"Wow, is this really what is talking about? Is this [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint]?"」<br>
—Yes. Please let me know quickly as we are running out of time.<br>
「"Hmm, I haven't had any talent for games since I was young—"」<br>
「"Well, I like games, but I’m not good at controlling them… so my friends don’t always join me…"」<br>
Damn, it seemed like that too.<br>
At that moment, several other carriages were approaching the carriage they were riding in. No matter how I looked at it, it didn't seem like they were approaching with good intentions.<br>
—Be careful!<br>
The window of the carriage running side by side opened and a barrage of sharp shuriken flew in.<br>
「"Waaaaaaah!"」<br>
The shurikens scraped against the carriage with a crunching sound. At a glance, it was an attack filled with powerful magical power.<br>
[The durability of the carriage has decreased!]<br>
I couldn't leave it like this.<br>
[There are 10 seconds left to stun.]<br>
I made a quick decision.<br>
"I will pass out for one more minute."<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv. 10' is activated!]<br>
[Stun time is extended!]<br>
[The usage time of the exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' stage 2, is extended!]<br>
—Hold your controller! Hurry!<br>
Kyung Sein grabbed the controller and attempted to accelerate. The distance between the carriages did not increase. Rather, the carriages naturally surrounded them as if they were playing a game.<br>
As the shurikens flew in from both sides and scratched the wheels of the carriage, the inside of the carriage shook as if it would overturn at any moment.<br>
The screams of Kyung Sein and Dansu ahjussi were heard.<br>
Then, pale smoke began to rise from the front of the carriage.<br>
[Warning! The carriage's durability is below 20%!]<br>
As the carriage slowed down, other carriages passed them mockingly. Fortunately, it appears that they did not intend to finish off the carriage.<br>
By the way, those carriages seem strangely fast—<br>
[The constellation 'Liverless Rabbit' is grinning.]<br>
[The story fragment 'Running Rabbit' begins its storytelling.]<br>
[The carriage receives acceleration correction from the story.]<br>
Damn it, it had to be the carriage with the 'Rabbit' version.<br>
Other carriages nearby also passed their  carriage.<br>
[Warning. The carriage incarnation that arrives last at the 'destination' cannot enter the 'Zodiac Ball'.]<br>
The expressions of Kyung Sein and Dansu ahjussi hardened at the message they heard.<br>
[All passengers on a carriage that does not arrive at the 'destination' die.]<br>
These were the rules of this game.<br>
It is a game in which incarnations who do not reach the destination are 'certainly destined to die'.<br>
That was the 'Orient Express Carriage'.<br>
And if things continue like this, there is a high probability that Dansu ahjussi and Kyung Sein’s carriage will not be able to avoid last place.<br>
I opened my mouth urgently.<br>
—Ahjussi, use a story.<br>
「"If it’s a story—"」<br>
—Have you forgotten what 'animal mask' you are wearing?<br>
At that moment, Dansu ahjussi’s eyes widened.<br>
Lee Dansu finally realized it too.<br>
An animal that runs slowly but steadily.<br>
And at least an animal that doesn't lose to 'rabbits'.<br>
—You might not know this from other Chinese zodiac signs, but no matter what happens, the turtle never loses to the rabbit.<br>
「"But will the stage work properly?"」<br>
—Of course. Because.<br>
Because the conditions for staging this story have just been met.<br>
[The story fragment 'The Turtle Incubating Someone Else’s Egg' begins its storytelling.]<br>
[The story fragment 'The Turtle Incubating Someone Else’s Egg' encounters the story 'Running Rabbit'.]<br>
[The story 'The Hare and the Tortoise' begins.]<br>
Along with the unfolding stage scene, the carriage's durability gauge began to rise little by little.<br>
[The story 'The Hare and the Tortoise' repairs the 'Orient Express Wagon'.]<br>
The speed of the carriage was also gradually increasing. A carriage that moves steadily at an honest but regular pace.<br>
Before I knew it, the carriages that had passed ahead began to come into view.<br>
「"Okay, okay! I'm really catching up!"」<br>
Done. Now, as long as you drive well, this carriage will reach its destination without any problems.<br>
「"Hmm."」<br>
The voice that suddenly came was not that of Dansu ahjussi or that of Kyung Sein.<br>
Is it because I'm too focused on the external situation? I didn't notice that there was a passenger in the carriage with<br>
When I looked closely, I saw that the passenger was someone I knew.<br>
「"You."」<br>
「"You can already use the power of the oldest dream."」<br>
He opened his mouth as if he could see me floating in the air.<br>
「"But you’d better not abuse that power."」<br>
How did  notice that I was here?<br>
Bicheonhori silently pointed his finger behind me.<br>
「"Dokja-ssi."」<br>
Someone's voice coming from behind, from very far away.<br>
A voice that seems to place a heavy weight on the heart.<br>
Right. [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] was this skill. That,<br>
「"Dokja hyung!"」<br>
It was a curse.<br>
「"Ahjussi!"」<br>
They were calling me.<br>
smiled as if he wanted to see that.<br>
「"You can’t become a 'recorder' yet. With so many voices holding onto you, how can you write the next story of this world"」<br>
Even after hearing those words, I couldn't help but look back.<br>
Now I am the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
This is because it was a constellation that loved stories more than anyone else in this world.<br>
「"Kim Dokja."」<br>
The moment I looked back, the scenery of the story changed once again.

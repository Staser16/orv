758 Episode 32 Monkey King (5)<br>
Why on earth is kkoma Kim Dokja here?<br>
"I’m glad that everyone likes ."<br>
When I turned my head, I saw Lee Jihye playing the Hwipirang. Even her facial expression was different from the younger Lee Jihye in the 41st round.<br>
Lee Jihye of <Kim Dokja Company> overcomes all her scenarios and eventually overcomes even her own sponsor to become the 'Lord of the Sea'.<br>
"I worked hard to collect your fragments."<br>
[Through Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint], her inner thoughts were heard at times.]<br>
[Your understanding of the person in question is insufficient.]<br>
Even though I couldn't hear it completely, it was enough to understand the situation.<br>
「In addition to the 41st round, there was a universe where 'Kim Dokja fragments' were scattered.」<br>
And Lee Jihye seems to have collected the 'Kim Dokja fragments' scattered throughout that universe.<br>
[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' finds it appetizing.]<br>
Perhaps this 'kkoma Kim Doka' is a kind of artificial life form created from the fragments of Kim Dokja.<br>
Crucially, this 'kkoma Kim Dokja' could  be felt as a soul. That's probably why I was able to possess it.<br>
The child who was lightly patting my cheek muttered.<br>
"Did you look like this when you were young?"<br>
"You were cute when you were young."<br>
Shin Yoosung and Lee Gilyoung.<br>
I slowly looked at their faces.<br>
In reality, it was my first time seeing these faces, but the feeling of familiarity was probably because I had already met Shin Yoosung in the 41st round.<br>
"If you say one word, I will kill you all."<br>
No, maybe I had also met 'Shin Yoosung' before my eyes.<br>
「"You're Kim Dokja."」<br>
This girl possessed herself in the 41st round and saved me several times.<br>
I carefully held the hand of the girl who was squeezing mine. It was only a subtle level of grip strength, but even with that, Shin Yoosung could sense something on my face.<br>
"What."<br>
Shin Yoosoung, who had been looking at me blankly, suddenly tilted her head.<br>
"Ahjussi?"<br>
Lee Seolhwa, who was watching the situation from afar, proached.<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Is it an illusion... I think the little man’s condition has just changed."<br>
In response to Shin Yoosung's words, Lee Seolhwa pulled up my top and took the stethoscope.<br>
"Well, let’s see."<br>
Doctor Lee Seolhwa.<br>
A person who looks almost no different from the 41st round just by face alone. The difference was the depth  her expression.<br>
Lee Seolhwa in the 41st round had a strangely strong spirit of experimentation, while Lee Seolhwa in <Kim Dokja Company> had the air of a seeker who was well versed in all the truths of the universe.<br>
Lee Seolhwa’s eyes met mine and drew a soft arc.<br>
"The story’s condition is stable."<br>
A doctor who steadfastly took care of the group even in places where Kim Dokja's eyes could not reach.<br>
As Kim Dokja expressed, without her, <Kim Dokja Company> would not have been able to reach the final scenario.<br>
Shin Yoosoung urgently grabbed my hand and comforted me.<br>
"Ahjussi, can you hear me?"<br>
", don’t bother the kkoma Dokja too much."<br>
"I didn’t mean to bother him."<br>
A gentle hand stroking my head. Yoo Sangah was looking down at me with her characteristic faint smile.<br>
As I looked at her smile, it occurred to me that Kim Dokja's story did not fully  her.<br>
Perhaps it was natural.<br>
Kim Dokja's mind is filled with the 'Ways of Survival', and the criteria for judgment are also within the 'Ways of Survival'.<br>
「The look is enough to slap Yoo Jonghyuk three times in the face.」<br>
If we were to apply the standards of 'Ways of Survival', Yoo Sangah was definitely a beautiful woman.<br>
Is it just how she looks? Her warm heart and warm consideration... But haven’t I been talking only about Yoo Sangah since a while ago?<br>
[The story fragment 'Kim Dokja who respects Yoo Sangah' continues its storytelling.]<br>
It was somehow strange.<br>
I guess this was the core story that made up 'kkoma Kim Dokja'.<br>
"But doesn’t that seem really dangerous?"<br>
Lee Jihye, who was looking at the display screen, said something.<br>
"What if they really die like that?"<br>
On the screen, Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin were still struggling to drive the carriage. As I was caught up in the shocking situation, I forgot about the people I was supposed to protect.<br>
Now was the time to unlock [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint].<br>
[A temporary error occurs in this skill.]<br>
[You cannot unlock level 3 of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'.]<br>
Shit. What is it again this time?<br>
I became impatient.<br>
On the screen, we saw enemies attacking the carriage we were riding in. Ji Eunyu and Cha Yerin are strong, but the situation is difficult with just the two of them.<br>
If I don't go right now—<br>
"Do you want me to possess my past self again?"<br>
Lee Gilyoung frowned at Shin Yoosoung’s question.<br>
"Shin Yoosoung, have you already forgotten that you suffered a probability aftermath before?"<br>
"…"<br>
"It would be better if I logged in as a constellation and used 'Deus Ex Machina'—"<br>
"Don’t be stupid. That’s a place where outside constellations can’t intervene."<br>
"Then why not just descend directly?"<br>
"Didn’t you hear that descending was prohibited? If you did something like that—"<br>
"The sooty bastard descended."<br>
"That’s because Jonghyuk ahjussi—"<br>
"Why can the sooty bastard do it and I can’t?"<br>
While Yoo Sangah, who was worse off, was trying to stop the two children, Lee Jihye looked at me this time and asked.<br>
"Kkoma, what do you think? Help me with that? Or not? I think I can just secretly go and use [Bonsal] once."<br>
My heart was beating slowly.<br>
I know it's just words. Because Lee Jihye doesn’t know that I am now possessing this 'kkoma Kim Dokja'.<br>
Still, I had a hard time shaking off the temptation of those words.<br>
「If only I could get help from <Kim Dokja Company>.」<br>
I thought of Ji Eunyu, Cha Yerin, Killer King Cha Sungwoo, Dansu ahjussi, and Kyung Sein's faces one after another.<br>
If we can get help from <Kim Dokja Company>, we may be able to guarantee the safety of the party.<br>
We will no longer have to face death scenarios.<br>
I moved my hand slowly.<br>
I was going to tell Lee Jihye. Please help, please help my companions not die— But at that moment, a light spark struck my head.<br>
「"Why did you want to become a writer?"」<br>
Distorted sentences appeared on Han Sooyoung’s dying face.<br>
「If we receive help from Kim Dokja Company here, whose story is it?」<br>
While I was breathing hard and blinking my eyes, Lee Jihye turned her head again and looked at her screen.<br>
「"I’ll drive. Can you take care of the carriage behind me?"」<br>
「"I heard Yerin-ssi is a minor."」<br>
「"Yes, but I really wanted to try driving at least once."」<br>
The carriage on the screen accelerated with a roar.<br>
The group watched the accelerating carriage in silence.<br>
「"Then I’ll leave it to you for a moment. Yerin, have you ever played a car game?"」<br>
「"I’ve never tried it, but I think I can try it!"」<br>
「"Okay. Every game has rules, so let's follow them. I'll take care of the carriage that follows, Yerin—"」<br>
Just as the constellations once watched their story. Just as Kim Dokja read Yoo Jonghyuk's story. <Kim Dokja Company> silently watched our story.<br>
"That person over there somehow looks like Sangah-ssi."<br>
Shin Yoosoung aid something.<br>
"She’s pretty good. It’s not as good as ours."<br>
Lee Gilyoung, who seems to be entering puberty, also left a comment. The companions smiled faintly.<br>
Meanwhile, Ji Eunyu blocked the attack of another carriage and overturned two carriages approaching from both sides.<br>
Yoo Sangah nodded her head.<br>
"She’s a good fighter."<br>
"We fought like that too. Do you remember? Back then—"<br>
The carriage ran away. A carriage that is neither Apollo's golden chariot nor Surya's train. Nevertheless, I knew what story my companions were seeing through that carriage.<br>
「I miss you.」<br>
As I listened to the sentence, where I couldn't tell who was thinking, I felt like my heart was breaking for some reason.<br>
<Kim Dokja Company> was located here.<br>
Even after their story was over, they remained here and missed the story. As I read the stories of myself and my companions, I was thinking about one person for a long time.<br>
「I miss you.」<br>
How long did they remember those years before a person's name finally became their life?<br>
Looking up at their faces, for the first time, I lost confidence in what I was about to do.<br>
「I was thinking of changing the ending of the 41st round.」<br>
What would happen to these people if I changed the fixed world line?<br>
If the ending of the 41st round is changed, will <Kim Dokja Company>, which was born from that ending, be safe?<br>
Will the probability of this world allow their longing?<br>
"Kim Dokja!"<br>
The group turned around at the same time at the loud, energetic tone.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk was there.<br>
"Kim Dokja!"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk was walking around with a serious expression, calling out Kim Dokja's name.<br>
Lee Jihye, who was observing Yoo Jonghyuk, asked.<br>
"You said you fought with Master Odin, right? Did you hit the wrong head?"<br>
In the end, Yoo Sangah, who was worse off, approached Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
"Jonghyuk-ssi. What’s going on?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk glared at Yoo Sangah for a moment, then began to look at the surrounding space with a bewildered look.<br>
About ten seconds like that.<br>
"There was Kim Dokja."<br>
"Yes?"<br>
"No, Kim Dokja has come."<br>
"What do you mean?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk said as if he was frustrated.<br>
"It means that 'Kim Dokja' is here now."<br>
"Yes? But Dokja-ssi—"<br>
Yoo Sangah, who had been talking up to that point, turned her gaze towards me.<br>
Yoo Sangah’s eyes slowly grew bigger.<br>
It was almost at the same time that Yoo Jonghyuk discovered me.<br>
This was the first time I knew [] was  good and fast. When I came to my senses, I was hanging in the air with Yoo Jonghyuk's hand holding my ankle.<br>
"No, Master! What should I do if I hear you say that!"<br>
"What is this?"<br>
"These are the fragments of ahjussi that I collected. Handle them carefully! They may break!"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk’s harsh eyes glared at me.<br>
I imagined turning off [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] several times in my head.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk said.<br>
"Kim Dokja."<br>
"Master, that’s not him. The real ahjussi is in there right now—"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk looked at the screen pointed to by Lee Jihye.<br>
Inside was my figure, stretched out like a squid and bouncing around in a rickety carriage.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk looked back and forth between me and me on the screen with confused eyes.<br>
"Wait a minute. The guy over there… he’s passed out just now, right?"<br>
It was then that Shin Yoosung opened her mouth.<br>
"A skill used every time my ahjussi faints."<br>
"No way—"<br>
One by one, the eyes of my companions turn to me gathered together.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, Yoo Sangah, Shin Yoosung, Lee Gilyoung, Lee Seolhwa, and Lee Jihye.<br>
The gathered group looked at each other with nervous eyes.<br>
"Jonghyuk-ssi, are you sure? Did you sense Dokja-ssi’s presence?"<br>
"That guy has a unique eerie feeling."<br>
"What do you think, what does the sooty bastard know?"<br>
"Can you feel  here now?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, who held me with his vicious hand, glared at me once again.<br>
And after a while, Yoo Jonghyuk's head moved slightly.<br>
The next moment, an eerie silence swept over the surroundings.<br>
The group members looked at each other's faces and nodded at the same time.<br>
"Let’s lock him up."

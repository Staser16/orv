759 Episode 32 Monkey King (6)<br>
No, wait!<br>
I wanted to shout that out to <Kim Dokja Copany>,  me with ferocious force.<br>
But I can't make a proper sound with this body.<br>
"Would you like to buy a cage first?"<br>
"Do you want to stay in the Dokkaebi’s Bag?"<br>
"Wouldn’t it be okay to ask Biyoo?"<br>
"Should I get a leash too?"<br>
"What kind of dog is this?"<br>
I overheard the conversation of my companions while clinging to Yoo Jonghyuk's grip. Meanwhile, Yoo Jonghyuk was glaring at me with strange eyes.<br>
[A temporary error occurs in this skill.]<br>
[You cannot unlock level 3 of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'.]<br>
The skill still did not listen. The moment when the fear rises that if I continue like this, I will really be imprisoned and not be able to go anywhere.<br>
"Okay, everyone, stop joking around."<br>
Yoo Sangah, with a gentle smile, held me up and stopped the crowd.<br>
"Huh? You weren’t really confining him, were you?"<br>
Lee Seolhwa, who had just brought a cart with iron bars, tilted her head and asked.<br>
Where on earth did she get something like that? No matter how you look at it, it looks like it's being used to confine laboratory animals.<br>
Yoo Sangah shook her head as if she could not stop her.<br>
Lee Gilyoung asked.<br>
"That little guy, he’s not understanding what we’re saying, is he?"<br>
"He understands."<br>
The other party members noticed Yoo Jonghyuk's answer and surrounded me.<br>
"Ahjussi, is that really you?"<br>
I wanted to answer, but no voice came out.<br>
Shin Yoosoung eemed to have noticed something in my appearance.<br>
"I guess he can’t speak."<br>
"How about we do it this way? First of all, since you can hear what we’re saying, we’ll have you answer with your eyes. Every time we ask a question, you blink once if we’re right, and blink twice if we’re wrong. Little guy, you get it?"<br>
It was a good idea.<br>
"Wow, Jihye.  know you  think like that?"<br>
While Lee Gilyoung, who was instantly caught in a headlock, whined, Yoo Sangah settled the situation.<br>
"Okay, then, shall we all calm down and ask questions? Since Dokja-ssi may be confused, ask questions one at a time. Um, shall we start with Gilyoung?"<br>
Then Lee Gilyoung quickly escaped the headlock and approached. Lee Gilyoung looked at me with suspicious eyes and hesitantly opened his mouth.<br>
"Dokja-hyung... is that right?"<br>
The most important question for them.<br>
Am I 'Kim Dokja' or not?<br>
The depth of silence replaced their curiosity.<br>
I blinked.<br>
"Once… twice… huh? Three times?"<br>
"Are you saying it’s true or not?"<br>
"Isn’t it true that it can be both right and wrong?"<br>
The group of people who were chatting about Lee Seolhwa’s words turned to me, holding their breath.<br>
I blinked as if agreeing with that.<br>
"Once! He blinked once!"<br>
"Are you saying what Seolhwa unnie said is correct?"<br>
"He is a Dokja, but he is not Dokja…"<br>
After pondering for a moment, the group members seemed to accept the meaning of the words in their own way.<br>
"What do you mean? Isn’t it hyung?"<br>
"No, he’s right…"<br>
"Well, the only guy left like this is still him."<br>
"Guys, calm down. You can’t ask questions."<br>
I felt strange. It was unfamiliar to me that there were people who showed such a variety of emotions just with my small reaction.<br>
"Dokja-ssi’s condition is strange."<br>
It was then that Lee Seolhwa, who was looking at me, suddenly approached me.<br>
There were faint sparks all around me.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' Lv. 3 is unstable.]<br>
Meanwhile, the status of the story became unstable.<br>
It was natural.<br>
No matter how much [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] it is, it is impossible to cross worldlines.<br>
An event that would never be possible without someone providing me with strong probability.<br>
Perhaps soon [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] will be lifted and I will return to the 41st round.<br>
"Oh, no, Seolhwa-ssi. Please save him!"<br>
"He’s not going to die. He’ll probably return to his original world."<br>
"Ahjussi, don’t go back, stay with us a little longer. Please. You’ve only been there a little while."<br>
"Shin Yoosoung."<br>
Shin Yoosoung did not listen to Yoo Sangah's dissuasion.<br>
Shin Yoosoung looked back at the screen and held my hand tightly.<br>
"I know you have a place to go to, and I know those people need you. But, but we also…"<br>
Shin Yoosoung, perhaps because her throat was so tight, could not bear to speak.<br>
But she could be heard clearly. Because I was now the 'Demon King of Salvation', and she was my incarnation.<br>
"We need you too."<br>
I wanted to say something.<br>
Can I convey my feelings by blinking my eyes violently?<br>
No, maybe I'm glad that blinking is all I can do.<br>
"Yoo Sangah. Let’s calm down and listen to Dokja-ssi. Seolhwa-ssi, how much time do we have left?"<br>
"It’s five minutes at most."<br>
"Shin Yoosoung, is there anything you want to ask Dokja-ssi?"<br>
At those words, everyone took a step back.<br>
Everyone had a question on their face, but they were willing to give up their questions for Shin Yoosoung.<br>
Shin Yoosoung asked me as if she were understanding the feelings of those people.<br>
"Ahjussi... why did you come here?"<br>
A question I cannot answer.<br>
Yoo Sangah lightly hugged the child's shoulder. On behalf of the trembling Shin Yoosoung, Yoo Sangah kindly changed her question.<br>
"Did you miss us by any chance?"<br>
Shin Yoosoung, who had lowered her head, looked up at me.<br>
Perhaps that was the real question Shin Yoosoung really wanted to ask.<br>
I looked at the face of <Kim Dokja Company>.<br>
「Let’s think that Kim Dokja is here now.」<br>
Shin Yoosoung, Lee Gilyoung, Yoo Sangah, Lee Jihye, Lee Seolhwa, Yoo Jonghyuk… And even Han Sooyoung, who is not here.<br>
I wanted to see their faces forever. I wanted to remember.<br>
I blinked slowly, as if taking a picture.<br>
"Ah."<br>
Shin Yoosoung’s  filled with tears. Lee Gilyoung slowly lowered his head, and Lee Jihye turned her head away and muttered something unintelligible. Lee Seolhwa examined me with a light sigh. Yoo Jonghyuk still looked at me with incomprehensible eyes.<br>
Yoo Sangah said with a bitter smile.<br>
"Thank you."<br>
I blinked twice, indicating that I did not deserve to hear such words.<br>
Slowly, Yoo Sangah’s face got closer.<br>
When her breath reached my ear, she whispered in a voice that only I could hear.<br>
"I know. Dokja-ssi is not the 'Kim Dokja' we remember."<br>
As expected, Yoo Sangah knew.<br>
"Still, we think Dokja-ssi is Dokja-ssi. No one can deny that."<br>
The person who still calls me 'Kim Dokja' even though I don’t even know how much percentage I have left.<br>
Yoo Sangah’s face slowly moved away. In a very clear voice she opened her mouth.<br>
"If it’s okay with you, Dokja-ssi, you can stay here."<br>
For a moment I thought I heard wrong.<br>
"We will provide the probability. As you can see, we are quite strong. Even so, we are all people who cleared the 'last scenario'."<br>
A stir arose deep within my heart.<br>
"Stay here. We’ll do something for the 41st round."<br>
What would happen if I really stayed here?<br>
As she said, if only we could solve the 41st round with their help.<br>
"That's right, Dokja-ssi. We can help! All I have to do is possess myself! Lee Gilyoung isn't much help either, but he accessed that place as a constellation and—"<br>
"If you want, I will go and fight for you."<br>
Their stories spoke to me.<br>
[The story 'Kim Dokja Company' begins its storytelling.]<br>
As the story began, I could clearly feel the white space between the lines supporting the sentences.<br>
The abyss of <Kim Dokja Company> that is never revealed to others.<br>
I once again realized what they had lost to come here.<br>
There were not many members of <Kim Dokja Company> present.<br>
Still, they didn't blame me.<br>
They were just telling me that it would be okay as long as I stayed on the line they made.<br>
[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' frowns.]<br>
What is so important about writing 'my story'?<br>
What Han Sooyoung said may be wrong. Maybe I'm not qualified to talk about the 41st round.<br>
Above all, the 41st round was the officially 'ended' story. No matter how hard I struggle, I cannot change the story.<br>
Maybe staying here would be a better choice than wasting time on such useless things.<br>
To spend the rest of my life serving those who find comfort in my presence—<br>
「"Where is that guy?"」<br>
When I looked up, a video was playing on the screen.<br>
「"Find that guy’s carriage."」<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk was speaking in the 41st round.<br>
「"If we are to see the end of the 'Recycling Center', we definitely need him."」<br>
If I give up here, what will happen to Yoo Jonghyuk?<br>
"Ahjussi?"<br>
Even while I was here, Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st round was fighting. He was running toward the end of a fleeting story that would ultimately fail.<br>
[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' grins.]<br>
Seeing Yoo Jonghyuk like that, I finally understood Kim Dokja.<br>
[The synchronization rate with your sponsor increases significantly.]<br>
Kim Dokja, who did not stay in the 1,863rd round was finally convinced of his return to his own world.<br>
"Yes? Ahjussi. Please stay here with me. Will you stay? Yes?"<br>
I looked the child in the eyes. But nothing was seen. Because Shin Yoosoung’s mall hands were covering my eyes.<br>
"No. Don’t answer."<br>
The hand that created the pitch-black darkness was trembling. Yoo Jonghyuk's voice was heard beyond the darkness.<br>
"Listen carefully, Kim Dokja."<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk was speaking in a voice that did not show the slightest agitation.<br>
"No matter what story you want, we will make it the ending we want. And you can’t stop it."<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk's back was seen between the child's fingers.<br>
It is said that he fought with Odin.<br>
Perhaps he was the one who protected the Demon King of Salvation and me beyond the 'Void Curtain'.<br>
"Dokja-ssi."<br>
Tsutsu, the air shook with sparks. The feeling that gently surrounded me was fading away.<br>
[The signal of 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' becomes weaker.]<br>
[Omniscient Reader’s View] is finally about to be released.<br>
Shin Yoosoung burst into tears once again, and Lee Gilyoung turned back. Lee Jihye took a step closer and held onto my arm.<br>
Yoo Sangah said.<br>
"Thank you for coming."<br>
While listening to Yoo Sangah's voice, I thought about Kim Dokja.<br>
"We’re okay. So, you, Dokja-ssi,  definitely survive to the end."<br>
But Kim Dokja was not there, and the only thing here was the helpless, blinking agent of the Demon King of Salvation.<br>
The air swirled along with people's voices.<br>
The world of <Kim Dokja Company> was fading away.<br>
I felt confident again.<br>
「Kim Dokja would have wanted to return to his companions more than anyone else.」<br>
Still, why didn't he come here?<br>
Why did he have to leave the people he loved the most?<br>
Then, a voice came from my fading consciousness.<br>
【Do you really want to know?】<br>
I could feel it instinctively.<br>
【Even if the truth could destroy you forever?】<br>
I know the owner of this voice.

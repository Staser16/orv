761 Episode 32 Monkey King (8)<br>
Unemployed Yoo Jonghyuk?<br>
I absentmindedly looked at the list of characters in the bookmarks. There was a memory that slowly emerged.<br>
「"I am neither employed nor unemployed."」<br>
Somehow, I felt like I knew what kind of Yoo Jonghyuk this 'Yoo Jonghyuk' was.<br>
Then I didn't have to hesitate.<br>
[The character 'Unemployed Yoo Jonghyuk' has been registered to bookmark number 1.]<br>
I don’t know what kind of 'unemployed' that 'unemployed' refers to—<br>
"I will activate bookmark number 1, 'Unemployed Yoo Jonghyuk'."<br>
Because no unemployed person in this world is better at playing games than him.<br>
"What did you just say?"<br>
"Please pretend you didn’t hear it."<br>
In response to Cha Yerin’s question, I shrugged my shoulders and looked ahead.<br>
[Activation time is determined in proportion to the level of the bookmark skill.]<br>
[Your understanding of the character is very low.]<br>
[The activation time of the Bookmark skill is partially corrected depending on your exclusive characteristics.]<br>
[Activation time: 10 minutes]<br>
…<br>
[Your physical composition is different from that of the character.]<br>
[Warning! The status of this character is abnormally high!]<br>
[The level of the activated skill is forcibly adjusted.]<br>
[You cannot choose which skills are activated.]<br>
Unfortunately, it was not possible to select the skill to be activated. However, according to my opinion, the skill activated by [Bookmark] is the main skill of the relevant 'character'.<br>
If the target had been 'King Yoo Jonghyuk', [Pacheongeomdo] would have been activated, but who I understood was 'Unemployed Yoo Jonghyuk'.<br>
If I remember correctly, Yoo Jonghyuk did not only train the 'sword' throughout his period of unemployed life. therefore-<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Sky View Lv.10' has been activated.]<br>
[You will be able to see the stars in the sky more clearly than anyone else.]<br>
I looked at the message with a devastated face.<br>
Is this ?<br>
"The speed is dropping."<br>
"I know. Don’t worry."<br>
I never thought I would develop a skill like this.<br>
Cannot help it. This time, I have no choice but to take the next best option.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Incite' Lv.10 is activated.]<br>
"I am 'Unemployed Yoo Jonghyuk' who is good at games."<br>
Cha Yerin looked at me like she was looking at Killer King. I ignored her gaze and focused on the effects of the skill.<br>
[Incite] could not activate specific skills as precisely as bookmark.<br>
However, the special advantage of this skill is that it can imitate the 'characteristics' of the person in question, albeit slightly.<br>
[Understanding of the exclusive skill 'Bookmark' affects the activation of 'Incite'.]<br>
[Bookmark number 1: Unemployed Yoo Jonghyuk’s attribute is activated.]<br>
I also have a conscience.<br>
I don’t even want to be the ‘ruler of entertainment’. So please—<br>
[Exclusive attribute 'Pro Gamer' is activated.]<br>
Yes. This is it!<br>
[All types of 'gaming skills' are greatly improved due to the effects of exclusive characteristics.]<br>
Suddenly the view became clear.<br>
I could see at a glance where to run on the terrain. Cornering here. Go straight here. It’s surprising. Is this the perspective of 'pro gamer Yoo Jonghyuk'?<br>
[Exclusive attribute discovers hidden pieces of the stage.]<br>
[The stage’s 'acceleration zone' has been discovered.]<br>
As we entered the acceleration zone at the correct timing, the carriage began to run at an unbelievable speed. It was almost questionable whether it was the same carriage.<br>
Cha Yerin also opened her mouth as she watched the scenery passing by quickly.<br>
Soon, the line of carriages ahead began to appear.<br>
Our group was also at the rear of the line.<br>
"Kim Dokja!"<br>
Killer King and Yoo Jonghyuk's carriage.<br>
"Dokja-ssi! Here we are! Come quickly!"<br>
And even the carriage of Dansu ahjussi and Kyung Sein next to them.<br>
I managed to breathe a sigh of relief. If this continues, we can at least avoid last place.<br>
Just go a little further. A little bit more-<br>
[The constellation 'The One Who Brought Ten Sheep' is worried about your safety!]<br>
[The constellation 'Reclining Dragon' warns you to run away quickly!]<br>
It was then that a strange message was heard from the air.<br>
[The constellation ' that brings plague' is opening their eyes!]<br>
[The constellation 'Tiger Who Eats Rice Cake' is greatly surprised!]<br>
[The constellation 'Liverless rabbit' gnaws at the spot where the liver used to be!]<br>
[A significant number of constellations doubt the probability of the incident.]<br>
[A few constellations feel fear.]<br>
I had an ominous feeling. Are the constellations expressing 'fear'?<br>
Tsutsutsu.<br>
Faint sparks flew from my arm as I adjusted the controller.<br>
The aftereffects of the probability aftermath.<br>
Why did probability suddenly become like this? Because I called 'Unemployed Yoo Jonghyuk' as [Bookmark]? Or not-<br>
[Someone violated an important probability of the <Star Stream>.]<br>
I felt like my heart was sinking.<br>
[The <Star Stream> detects your story.]<br>
[You temporarily experienced another world line.]<br>
[You have not completed the 'Returnee Scenario'.]<br>
[The probability of the <Star Stream> is moving.]<br>
[The Edge of the Other World will be expanded for 10 minutes from now.]<br>
Lightning struck from the sky, and the carriages running behind were destroyed with a loud noise.<br>
Something was chasing us through the thick clouds of dust.<br>
"Ah."<br>
There was a faint fear in Cha Yerin's voice. It was not difficult to realize the source of the fear.<br>
At the back of the carriage, visible through a cloud of pitch-black dust, were seven-tailed dogs. A fear that seems to freeze your soul just by looking into your eyes.<br>
['The Hound of the Abyss' has found you.]<br>
A hound chasing the abyss.<br>
Sentinels who kill 'Outer Gods' who harm the balance of the world line and destroy probability.<br>
The hounds were chasing me this time. The reason was obvious.<br>
「Because I came to meet <Kim Dokja Company>.」<br>
I bit my lip and confessed the truth.<br>
"I’m sorry. I guess it’s because of me."<br>
"Why the author—"<br>
"I’ll give you a detailed explanation later."<br>
I held on to the controller with all my might and somehow continued to accelerate.<br>
But it was useless. It was not a problem that could be overcome simply through the power of characteristics. The distance between me and the dogs was rapidly shrinking.<br>
If things continue like this, we will be caught quickly.<br>
"Yerin-ssi."<br>
Even if I handed over the controller to Cha Yerin, I had to stop the dogs.<br>
[Your exclusive characteristics are activated.]<br>
In my head, I thought about how to deal with the 'hounds chasing the abyss'.<br>
However, neither the 'Ways of Survival' nor the 'Omniscient Reader' contained any instructions on how to deal with those hunting dogs.<br>
It was natural.<br>
Even Yoo Jonghyuk, who had reached the end of the scenarios, was reluctant because those dogs were .<br>
Of course, the number was not as large as it was then. Five or six at most.<br>
But for me now, it was difficult to deal with even that one dog.<br>
"I guess I’ll do it myself—"<br>
At that moment, a dog ran to the point and jumped onto the roof of the carriage. The moment I made eye contact with the hunting dog, I realized.<br>
I can't deal with this.<br>
This 'hound' was not a being but a 'phenomenon'. For example, something like the 'indescribable ' that is a disaster.<br>
No matter what I do with my current level of power, I can't resist these guys' pursuit.<br>
[I was wondering why it was suddenly noisy.]<br>
The charging hound flew away with a fierce spark.<br>
I reflexively looked back.<br>
[I told you to wake me up when you arrived at the destination, but you just left me.]<br>
A golden monkey was standing on the torn-off roof of the carriage with a bored expression on his face.<br>
"!"<br>
took out something that looked like a toothpick from his ear and blew on it, revealing his main sacred relic.<br>
Yeouigeumgobong?<br>
No. There was something different about that. A relic that has the same shape as the of , but has a 'different name'.<br>
Just as the sword ‘Amanomurakumono no Tsurugi’ made from the tail of ‘Yamata no Orochi’ was divided into ‘different swords’ according to the number in its name, the same was true for Sun Wukong’s .<br>
[This guy,  you recogniz Shin Jincheol, the king of the world?]<br>
His Majesty Jeongjeo Shin Jincheol.<br>
That was the original name of .<br>
A tool used to measure the depth of rivers and seas around the world.<br>
The 'Sea Pendulum' was stored in the warehouse of Ogwang, the Dragon King of the East Sea.<br>
, waving his sacred , spoke.<br>
[I don’t know why the dogs of this world are chasing you, but—]<br>
His gaze rested on Ji Eunyu, who had collapsed in the carriage, for a moment.<br>
[Please take care of that child.]<br>
floated in the air, his golden fur fluttering. The moment his new  passed me, I got goosebumps.<br>
He shouted as he faced the stars of the Chinese zodiac.<br>
[You foolish unemployed people.]<br>
As far as I know, there is no official head in the Zodiac. This is because no one claimed to be the 'head'.<br>
[These hounds are also just 'dogs'. It means that they are beasts like you. What are you so scared of?]<br>
But I knew it the moment I saw him.<br>
[All the constellations of the Chinese zodiac are shaking.]<br>
The reason why there was no official head in the <Zodiac> was because everyone in the <Zodiac> implicitly agreed on who their 'head' was.<br>
[The scale of the sea.]<br>
He is the king of all beasts.<br>
[I let go of your true self.]<br>
A heavenly villain that no one in <Emperor> dared to deal with.<br>
The monkey king of Huagu Mountain.<br>
[The scale of probability moves.]<br>
, who had raised his level to the point where he could take on the 'hound chasing the abyss', roared into the air.<br>
Shin Jincheol, whose  increased in an instant, grew to over hundreds, thousands, and several kilometers. It no longer looked like a rod at all.<br>
Is it because Shin Jincheol’s  was increasing in real time? The hunting dogs were already pushed far away.<br>
[Good. I can't take too long.]<br>
A faint spark was flowing from 's whole body.<br>
[Damn, if I didn’t give Jecheon that hair, it would be like this…]<br>
I nodded and immediately started accelerating.<br>
is a legendary constellationhow vicious the hunting dogs are, they will not die easilyhere.<br>
I ran the carriage again and again. I had to use the little time that  gave me wisely.<br>
How long did it run like that?<br>
Smoke rose from the wheels of the carriage and the wheels stopped.<br>
Now the destination is just around the corner. A huge fortress was visible in the distance.<br>
Cha Yerin and I exchanged glances and then started running with Ji Eunyu on our backs.<br>
And soon we arrived at the entrance of the fort.<br>
[You have arrived at your 'destination'.]<br>
It's a success. It's not too late.<br>
Fortunately, at the entrance, Yoo Jonghyuk, Killer King, Dansu ahjussi, and Kyung Sein were all present.<br>
They  waiting for me.<br>
"You’ve arrived."<br>
I nodded and walked past them. The distant explosions were getting closer.<br>
If we didn't get inside quickly, we couldn't guarantee that it would be safe until then.<br>
Guarding the entrance was a low-level dokkaebi who served as the gatekeeper.<br>
[Prove your entry qualifications.]<br>
"I am 'Kim Dokja' from Zone 13. Let my forces in."<br>
But the dokkaebi just frowned as if it was annoying.<br>
[The incarnation you are carrying is allowed to enter.]<br>
I glanced back at Ji Eunyu, who I was carrying. She was still unconscious.<br>
[She belongs to the 'monkey faction'. But you are not affiliated with any faction. Prove your affiliation.]<br>
"I would have said I was from Zone 13."<br>
[I haven’t heard of incarnations from Zone 13 coming up—]<br>
As I slowly raised my status, the expression of the low-level dokkabi changed as it sensed the energy of a constellation in me.<br>
[So, are you a constellation? However, 'Zone 13' is not an official force. If you would like to enter—]<br>
The low-level dokkaebi hesitated for a moment and then said:<br>
[Please name the 'force' you belong to.]<br>
I looked back at my companions.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, who turned his back as if he didn't care about the name, stood at the back of the group.<br>
"There is no time, so decide quickly."<br>
I watched Killer King, Literature Girl 64, Lee Dansu, and Kyung Sein while being grateful for their consideration.<br>
And then I thought about their real names.<br>
Cha Sungwoo, Cha Yerin, Noh Kyunghwan, Sung Minwoo.<br>
Maybe we would have thought of the same name at that moment. The only name that binds us who wrote, read, and lived that long story.<br>
My companions nodded and I opened my mouth.<br>
"『Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint』."<br>
The door to the fortress slowly opened.<br>
[You have reached the upper level of the 'Recycling Center'.]<br>
Constellations were waiting for us.<br>
(TL: This episode’s title can be translated as both Monkey King and Unemployed King, so I don’t know.)

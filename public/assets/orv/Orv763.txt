(TL: Please refrain from changing chapters’ format (i.e. font, letter size, color, background, etc…) If you really need to, please open a separate copy.)<br>
[You all know who I’m talking about, right? 'Gourmet Association' people especially.]<br>
The concentration of attention was burdensome.<br>
Light laughter was heard from the second floor. It seemed like someone was muttering,that Kim Dokja?"<br>
[The constellations of the 'Gourmet Association' are looking at you.]<br>
Monsters on a different level from the great-grade were sitting there. Each and every one of them calls themselves the  of the whole world.<br>
Cold sweat formed on my neck and I slowly began to feel suffocated.<br>
Kim Dokja has been fighting against such monsters until now.<br>
I pursed my lips and raised my hand toward them. It was because I thought that if I got discouraged here, I wouldn't be able to face the others later.<br>
I was the one who brought them on this stage in the first place.<br>
I created a story by changing the 'animal tales' of Zone 13, and distributed the stories to the Gourmet Association through Bihyung.<br>
The fact that they came this far means that they fell for the bait I spread.<br>
[Your story will become known in the <Star Stream>.]<br>
[15,000 coins were obtained.]<br>
Messages heard in real time.<br>
It was proof that our stories were being steadily consumed in the <Star Stream>.<br>
If so, great. Spend as much as you want. I will feed you stories until your stomach explodes and you die.<br>
[The constellations of the 'Gourmet Association' welcome you!]<br>
It felt like blood was flowing from my lips that had been so tightly pressed. The moment when it became difficult to bear the gaze of the constellations.<br>
[The constellation 'The One Who Brought Ten Lambs' restrains the constellations belonging to the Gourmet Association.]<br>
As soon as I received the message, the pressure that had been weighing me down seemed to have disappeared.<br>
I barely breathed a sigh of relief and nodded lightly toward the evaluator behind the curtain.<br>
However, despite the evaluator's restraint, there were still constellations looking at me.<br>
The constellations of the <Zodiac> on the first floor were like that.<br>
It wasn't a threatening gaze like the constellations on the second floor, but I could feel resentment in their gaze for some unknown reason.<br>
Euphrosyne spoke again.<br>
[Anyway, thanks to you, we found out. Old stories can be just as fun! Just because the generation is older doesn’t mean the <Star Stream> has lost its usefulness!]<br>
To summarize, is it true that I designed the scenario stage inspired by the 'animal stories' that I changed?<br>
For some reason, I didn't have a good feeling.<br>
[In this scenario, you will see a reenactment of an old tale!]<br>
A reenactment of an old tale.<br>
Since this is the <Zodiac Ball>, the background of the dance was likely to be famous animal tales, including the 'Zodiac Race'.<br>
However, the variable was that the 'Gourmet Association' directly intervened.<br>
Since there are many stubborn constellations in the Gourmet Association, there was a possibility that something like the 'Bracelet Expedition', which was the stage of the Gourmet Association in the main story, could be recreated.<br>
[Wow, everyone’s faces are full of concern. Do not worry. I didn't come with that much old-fashioned stories. What fun would it be to try something like the 'Zodiac Race' again?]<br>
It isn’t the zodiac race?<br>
So is it really the Bracelet Expedition?<br>
[For those who like 11th generation stories, please bear with me this time. Now, shouldn’t the Gourmet Association also need to reform its image? It can't be called a gathering of constellations that only eat weird food forever, right?]<br>
I don't think it's the Bracelet Expedition either.<br>
So what on earth is it?<br>
[Ahaha, everyone is very worried. Rest assured. To design the stage for this scenario, I received help from the 'Management Bureau' dokkaebis!]<br>
Euphrosyne waved her hand lightly into the air. Although I can't see it, there are probably dokkaebis from the management bureau, including Bihyung, there.<br>
Some<br>
[The Administration intervened? Only in the ninth scenario?]<br>
[Probably not. The fact that the management bureau moved even before the scenario started...]<br>
Euphrosyne seemed to have heard them and nodded.<br>
[Right! There is no way such a big event could happen in only the ninth scenario. You're smart.]<br>
The ominous premonition was gradually becoming a reality.<br>
The moment when a cruel smile appeared on Euphrosyne's lips.<br>
[You guys are right.]<br>
The balance of the world began to creak.<br>
[Many constellations would like to view this scenario.]<br>
[The Constellations of the Gourmet Association are willing to pay for the probability of proceeding with this scenario!]<br>
[The probability of the <Star Stream> is moving.]<br>
There were just scenario messages being exchanged, but probability was flying out of thin air. A transfer that has occurred only a few times in 'Ways of Survival' and 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'.<br>
And I knew when this 'miracle' would occur.<br>
「When the scenario difficulty level is increased abnormally.」<br>
I felt dizzy and felt like my stomach was turning. It was difficult to move my body as if the gravity of the area had been reversed.<br>
When I shook my head several times and finally came to my senses, a message appeared before my eyes.<br>
[The number of the scenario will change.]<br>
[You are qualified to participate in the '20th Main Scenario'.]<br>
*<br>
The banquet was halted for a moment.<br>
This is because the constellations of the Zodiac and the incarnations each needed time to recover from the shock.<br>
The twentieth main scenario.<br>
Suddenly the scenario level rose by eleven levels. Although it was rare in mid- to late-game scenarios, I've never seen this happen in the ninth scenario.<br>
The fact that the scenario level has risen by 11 levels means that the scenario difficulty has also been upgraded accordingly.<br>
[Does this make sense—]<br>
Some high-ranking constellations began to protest.<br>
[Who can control the difficulty level of the scenario...]<br>
[Since when did the <Star Stream> become your playground!]<br>
The constellations in the zodiac, unable to bear it, pointed their pointed fingers at the dokkaebis in the air.<br>
I waited for the next message without reacting in any way.<br>
This level of dramatic change in scenarios will inevitably bring about probability repercussions. So, if it were as I expected, the management bureau would have put in place a safety device to prevent any repercussions.<br>
['Ninth Scenario' participants can choose to participate in the '20th Scenario'.]<br>
[If you choose not to participate, you will be kicked out of the 'Recycling Center'.]<br>
[For the deportees, a new 'ninth scenario' is rehabilitation.]<br>
I knew it. No matter how bad the Star Stream is, it<br>
[Damn, if that’s the case, I’d tell you right away—]<br>
[I, I will not participate in the scenario!]<br>
In other words, you are free to choose whether to participate in a new scenario or not.<br>
Constellations from all over began to leave the 'Recycling Center', taking incarnations with them.<br>
It was an obvious choice.<br>
No constellation would want to participate in this unpleasant scenario.<br>
[Well, there are already constellations who are making hasty choices.]<br>
At least, unless there is corresponding compensation.<br>
[That's too bad. With the reward from this scenario, even a low-ranking great-grade constellation could instantly become a narrative-grade constellation...]<br>
The constellations on the <Zodiac> side, who were leaving the scenario, stopped as Euphrosyne muttered to herself.<br>
[What does that mean? A great-grade  immediately becomes a narrative-grade?]<br>
[If you’re curious, wouldn’t it be okay to stay in the scenario? Oh, I'm not forcing it.]<br>
Maybe there is no freedom in this world. The idea of ​​free choice is nothing more than a mirage.<br>
[Is it real?]<br>
[You can’t lie compensation.]<br>
[If it is to the extent of immediately upgrading the level of a great-grade to the level of a narrative-grade... Is it really possible that a mythical story will be released as a product?]<br>
[Hey, are you really leaving? There may never be another opportunity like this.]<br>
[If the reward is that much in the 20th scenario, it's worth a try.]<br>
[It’s better than suffering outside. The Gourmet Association is annoying, but…]<br>
A muffled laugh could be heard from beyond the curtains on the second floor.<br>
They probably already knew. The fact that the constellations on the first floor would never be able to reject this proposal.<br>
In the end, the destination of the stars' desires is the same. It's the same whether it's a great-grade, a narrative-grade, or a mythical-grade.<br>
[Ah, for those of you who are curious, let me show you the scenario rewards in advance...]<br>
And maybe me too.<br>
[Have you all heard of it? This is one the ‘fragments of the oldest dream’ that have been floating around the world recently.]<br>
The moment I saw the image rising behind Euphrosyne, time seemed to stop.<br>
[I am introducing. Fragments of 'the oldest dream'.]<br>
'Kim Dokja', who had the same face as me, was sealed in the tank.<br>
He sacrificed himself to save me, my brother who was consecrated to the scenario.<br>
[This is the 'Demon King of Salvation'.]<br>
*<br>
The Demon King of Salvation.<br>
In the pitch-black night sky, Lee Gilyoung rewrote those words with his fingers several times. The trace imbued with pure white magic was quickly erased, but Lee Gilyoung constantly filled in new traces on top of the disappearing trace.<br>
"What are you doing?"<br>
Lee Gilyoung turned his head halfway in response to the question and then fixed his gaze on the sky again. Then the owner of the voice took Lee Gilyoung’s hat off.<br>
"Now, when your noona calls you, you don’t even look at her."<br>
"What. Why?"<br>
Lee Jihye, who took Lee Gilyoung's hat, placed his hat on her own head. The hat fit well without any need to adjust the size.<br>
Lee Gilyoung grumbled and said.<br>
"If you came here to start a fight, just leave."<br>
Lee Jihye looked down at the back of the boy's pouty head. Lee Jihye actually knew why the back of this boy's head was so prickly.<br>
「The condition for activating [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint] is for the ahjussi and the target to think about each other at the same time.」<br>
Lee Jhye, who was looking down at Lee Gilyung who had stopped, drew her sword and wrote letters in the air.<br>
The Demon King of Salvation.<br>
Letters engraved like a calligrapher’s calligraphy.<br>
Lee Gilyoung asked with his mouth slightly open.<br>
"Do you know how to do that too? Teach me too."<br>
Lee Jihye sighed lightly and said.<br>
"Even if I write it like this, you’re going to read it to me."<br>
"Still."<br>
"Let’s stop and go in, it’s cold."<br>
"…Hyung."<br>
A tremor at the end of words.<br>
Lee Jihye's steps suddenly stopped.<br>
"Does hyung think of me sometimes?"<br>
"Well, maybe sometimes?"<br>
"I’m not someone else, I’m Lee Gilyoung."<br>
"It’s a circle sound."<br>
"Shin Yoosoung is the incarnation of hyung, and Sangah is hyung’s best friend."<br>
Lee Gilyoung hesitated for a moment and then continued.<br>
"The sooty bastard, Seolhwa, and the noona are characters from a novel that hyung liked."<br>
"Hey."<br>
"But I am nothing."<br>
The magic flowing from Lee Jihye's blade dimly illuminated Lee Gilyoung's face.<br>
"Why did he save me?"<br>
How long has the child been pondering that question alone?<br>
"I wish I could ask him just once. It’s okay if I can’t ask him any other questions, so I wish I could ask him just once. I should have asked then. I shouldn’t have given in to Shin Yoosoung."<br>
The energy of the story slowly flowed from Lee Gilyoung’s whole body.<br>
It was a story of the demon god Abaddon.<br>
Lee Jihye’s expression hardened.<br>
"Hey, calm down."<br>
"It’s okay just once—"<br>
"Stories are leaking!"<br>
The moment Lee Jihye held onto Lee Gilyoung's shoulder after her urgent shout, sparks flew out in the air. At first, she thought the story of Abaddon had gone wild.<br>
But it wasn't.<br>
The spark was hovering in the air nearby, not at Lee Gilyoung.<br>
"That one over there."<br>
Not long ago, Kim Dokja, who used [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint], disappeared.<br>
A place where the world line opens and closes.<br>
Something was flowing through that place.<br>
The moment a nervous Lee Jihye grasped the hilt of her sword, a message was heard.<br>
[The invitation has arrived.]<br>
A message that somehow feels like déjà vu.<br>
They knew this feeling of déjà vu well.<br>
A 'scenario'.<br>
But they already cleared all the 'scenarios' a long time ago.<br>
But why now?<br>
[Someone invited you to the scenario '◼️◼️◼️ ◼️◼️◼️◼️'.]<br>
Why did a 'scenario' message appear before their eyes once again?<br>
"What is this?"<br>
It was an invitation that they would have naturally declined under normal circumstances. There was no way they would respond to such a suspicious invitation.<br>
They would have immediately shown the message to Yoo Sangah and Lee Seolhwa and then judged the situation.<br>
But the moment they saw the scenario message that followed.<br>
[Through this scenario, you can meet the 'Demon King of Salvation' once again.]<br>
There was only one option left for them.

764 Episode 33 Ball (3)<br>
Immediately after the twentieth scenario product was released, the hall was filled with excitement for a while.<br>
But do know who the 'Demon King of Salvation' is?<br>
[I heard the story. He is the one who fought against Ares, who had half his powers.]<br>
[So you are allowing me to eat his entire tale?]<br>
[If it is possible to prey on an Ares-level constellation, it would be possible for a great-grade to become a narrative-grade in an instant.]<br>
[But wasn’t there a guy called the Demon King of Salvation here too?]<br>
I quietly hid behind the pillar next to the table. There was something unusual going on in the atmosphere.<br>
I already knew that information about the 'Kim Dokja fragments' had spread outside. However, it seemed like the information was slowly starting to spread within the Recycling Center as well.<br>
—You probably already know this.<br>
Bihyung’s 'dokkaebi communication' was heard in the air.<br>
—You know that’s a great product, right?<br>
The term 'product' bothered me, but I nodded with effort.<br>
'I know. Because it's my sponsor.'<br>
The Kim Dokja sleeping in the fish tank really looked like the Kim Dokja I remembered.<br>
Of course, I know that Kim Dokja is not that Kim Dokja. It's just the embodiment of his story.<br>
Still, as I looked at him, a corner of my heart throbbed.<br>
—It's not just your sponsor. Have you never heard of 'Fragments of the Oldest Dream'?<br>
Of course it was information I knew, but I deliberately did not reply. Because I wanted to hear what Bihyung would say.<br>
—The Oldest Dream. It is a star that is designated as the first 'cause' of all these worlds.<br>
The first cause of all these worlds.<br>
Did the middle and lower level dokkaebis even know this information?<br>
I couldn't remember very well.<br>
Maybe it's a feature unique to the 41st round.<br>
—There is a story that fragments of that constellation have recently been discovered throughout the <Star Stream>.<br>
'My sponsor is one of them.'<br>
—It's a very big 'one'. This information is still known only to large nebulae or high-ranking constellations. This is what the 'Recycling Center' revealed this time.<br>
Honestly, when I heard this, I didn't really understand it.<br>
Even though it is only the 20th scenario, they are offering the 'Demon King of Salvation' as a scenario product?<br>
Let's say the management bureau can do that. But does it make sense for the 'Gourmet Association' to participate in it?<br>
If there was such a coveted story, they would be the first to taste it, right?<br>
—Anyway, be careful with this scenario. Even if you are the 'incarnation of the Oldest Dream', it won’t be easy.<br>
'The incarnation of the Oldest Dream?'<br>
—Some constellations call you that.<br>
In that case, there was something completely wrong with the name. This is because I am the incarnation of the 'Demon King of Salvation', not the incarnation of the 'Oldest Dream'.<br>
The incarnation of the 'Oldest Dream' refers to the guy who is now walking from the other side with wide open eyes.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk."<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk from 41st round. The side effects of the 'Story Imprint' seem to have been alleviated considerably, and his height, which was previously that of a boy, has now returned to that of a young man.<br>
Behind Yoo Jonghyuk the group that had disappeared into the incarnation waiting room .<br>
I lightly raised my hand towards them.<br>
"Have you all seen the new scenario that came out?"<br>
"Yes. What about you, Dokja-ssi? How did the constellations react?"<br>
"Everyone was shocked, well."<br>
"Hey, there’s nothing special about the constellations."<br>
Kyung Sein, who rushed over, was the first to murmur. After that, Dansu ahjussi and Cha Yerin were also seen.<br>
"Ji Eunyu-ssi was  "<br>
After all,. It seemed like he had safely escaped from the hunting dogs.<br>
"My brother went somewhere alone for a while."<br>
He probably went there to prepare for the next scenario. Killer King may seem absurd on the outside, but he is thorough when it comes to scenarios.<br>
But my companions seemed to have something else they wanted to say.<br>
I looked into their eyes closely and asked.<br>
"Who else was in the waiting room?"<br>
"There were a lot. I also saw Anna Croft and Asuka Ren."<br>
Anna Croft and Asuka Ren.<br>
Were they also active at the 'Recycling Center'? I don't know which faction they chose, but if we become enemies with them, things won't be easy.<br>
"But they both got off."<br>
I couldn't believe my ears.<br>
"Those two quit the scenario?"<br>
"Yes. This time, with the difficulty level being raised, it became possible to escape the scenario. They escaped right then."<br>
Even if Asuka Ren is like that, what about Anna Croft? There is no way the Prophet could have run away even after checking the product details?<br>
"And Anna told me to give you this."<br>
Cha Yerin said that and handed over a crumpled paper<br>
—I give in this time.<br>
The moment I read the neatly written handwriting, I smiled bitterly.<br>
.<br>
A prophet would have already figured out how things are going here.<br>
It was at that time that Dansu ahjussi, who had been listening and observing the conversation, opened his mouth.<br>
"By the way, friend. Can I ask you one thing?"<br>
"Yes. Just ask."<br>
"That face…"<br>
It did. I was wondering when you would ask.<br>
I looked at my face reflected in the glass on the table.<br>
No matter how you look at it, it's the same face as Kim Dokja.<br>
It may have seemed strange to the party members who were familiar with Cheon Inho's face.<br>
Dansu ahjussi, who had been pausing, asked with a heavy expression.<br>
"Why have you suddenly become so handsome?"<br>
I looked blankly at Dansu ahjussi. Then Kyung Sein intervened.<br>
"Hey, ahjussi! That’s not the question!"<br>
"Yes? Then…"<br>
"You don’t know whose face that face is?"<br>
"Whose face is it?"<br>
"It’s Kim Dokja, Kim Dokja!"<br>
"Ah."<br>
Now that I think about it, Dansu ahjussi has only read the entire novel once.<br>
And the favorite of Jiyoon, the daughter of Dansu ahjussi, was Yoo Jonghyuk. It wasn't strange that he didn't know Kim Dokja's face.<br>
"Then it’s even weirder. If that’s really Kim Dokja’s face—"<br>
"Ahjussi."<br>
Kyung Sein grabbed Dansu ahjussi’s wrist. It was as if she was telling him not to say any more.<br>
As expected, the sense of discomfort I felt from my companions earlier was not an illusion.<br>
Their eyes look strangely anxious every time they look at me.<br>
I looked at my companions with calm eyes and asked.<br>
"What happened in the waiting room?"<br>
In the end, Kyung Sein, who had hesitated, opened her mouth first.<br>
"Actually, I met Ye Hyunwoo in the waiting room."<br>
"Ah."<br>
"And Goo Seonah. Do you remember Goo Seonah? She used to use iron guns in Chungmuro—"<br>
"I remember."<br>
Gu Seonah, the Cheolgon woman.<br>
The last time I saw her was at Gwanghwamun Station.<br>
At that time, I, who had just started reading 『Heir of the Eternal Name』, absorbed the soul of Kim Kyungsik, who became a 'Kim Dokja fragment'.<br>
Goo Seonah, who happened to witness the scene, was greatly shocked and left Gwanghwamun.<br>
I was worried because she hadn't been seen since, but it appears she was also a participant in this scenario.<br>
"Seonah said something a little strange."<br>
Kyung Sein took a deep breath and looked straight into my eyes and said.<br>
"Don’t trust Dokja-ssi."<br>
I thought I knew why Goo Seonah said that.<br>
Because she clearly saw me absorbing Kim Kyungsik.<br>
I don't know if Goo Seonah told my group in detail or not, but if that causes my group to stop trusting me...<br>
"There’s no need to look so serious."<br>
When I turned my head, Dansu ahjussi was speaking with stern eyes.<br>
"If we don’t trust you, who will we trust?"<br>
"I think so too. I was just worried that Goo Seonah said something strange, so I was wondering whether I should tell it or not. Dokja-ssi might be offended."<br>
I once again felt sorry for my companions.<br>
If they found out that I was becoming stronger by absorbing the 'Kim Dokja fragments', if they found out that I absorbed Kim Kyungsik’s soul… Will my companions treat me like they do now even then?<br>
"But when I see your face, I feel like I have to tell you."<br>
"My face?"<br>
"Yes, because those two—"<br>
The moment I heard the next words, I felt my heart lightly sink.<br>
"It’s a little, but... Goo Seonah and Ye Hyunwoo also had similar faces to the current Dokja-ssi."<br>
*<br>
Goo Seonah and Ye Hyunwoo,<br>
I wanted to meet them and talk to them if possible, but it seemed like they wouldn't come to the hall.<br>
[Story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' chuckles.]<br>
Two people turned into faces similar to mine.<br>
It wasn't entirely unexpected. In the end, the more 'Kim Dokja fragments' we collect, the more similar we become to 'Kim Dokja'.<br>
The fact that their facial features have changed must be proof that they have also collected a certain number of 'fragments of Kim Dokja'.<br>
[Start entering the scenario.]<br>
[If you agree to enter, please enter through the door in the center of the hall.]<br>
Before we knew it, it was time to enter the scenario.<br>
I looked back at my companions and said.<br>
"I’m asking just in case you don’t know…"<br>
Cha Yerin answered as if she already knew my question.<br>
"You will tell us not to participate."<br>
"I think so."<br>
'Twentieth' main scenario.<br>
This scenario was of the same level of difficulty as the 73rd Demon World. Monsters equivalent to demon nobles will appear, and boss-level monsters equivalent to demon dukes or constellations will appear.<br>
Is that it?<br>
We must fight against the other constellations of the zodiac. This means that confrontations with at least great-grade constellations are inevitably scheduled.<br>
"We’ve fought with the constellations before."<br>
"The probability tolerance is different from the eighth scenario."<br>
Most of the constellations we faced were guys who had squandered their reputation. Even those who appeared awkwardly, bound by the probability constraints of lower-level scenarios.<br>
However, the '20th' scenario is a different story.<br>
Then Cha Ye-mrin asked.<br>
"What do you think Kim Dokja would have done?"<br>
What would Kim Dokja have done?<br>
None of us knew the answer.<br>
Kyung Sein laughed.<br>
"Have you forgotten? We are also 'Kim Dokja'."<br>
Dansu ahjussi nodded and said.<br>
"We also have an 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint'."<br>
I sighed lightly and said.<br>
"You know that survival is the top priority, right?"<br>
My companions nodded.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, who had been listening to the story as if he was not interested, walked past us first, and Killer King appeared from nowhere and followed him.<br>
"Let's go."<br>
[Entering a new scenario area!]<br>
A bright beam of light enveloped our entire bodies and the landscape began to change.<br>
Although I spoke calmly, I was actually very worried about this scenario.<br>
Even in the 'Ways of Survival', the 'Recycling Center' scenario has never unfolded like it does now. The stage for this scenario was a place that even I didn't really know about.<br>
"...Thus, the Demon King of the beginning arose from the conflict between good and evil..."<br>
A voice that occasionally reaches my ears. It was a calm and intelligent voice. A powerful tone that feels like something I've heard before.<br>
"...So, the cause of the Holy Demon War..."<br>
When I slowly opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was the neat letters written on the blackboard.<br>
「History of the Demon World.」<br>
I stared at the blackboard for a long time, wondering if I was looking at something in vain.<br>
But nothing changed.<br>
Across the blackboard, I could see the backs of the students' heads sitting on chairs and taking class.<br>
It's definitely true. This was a school.<br>
No, why am I at school?<br>
As I unconsciously turned my head, I saw my reflection in the window. A name tag was attached to the chest of the refreshing beige school uniform.<br>
[Kim Dokja].<br>
Goosebumps slowly appeared.<br>
"Hmm, what’s outside the window?"<br>
The teacher was looking at me. As I slowly stood up, I could see the teacher's face more clearly.<br>
Then I realized why I thought his voice sounded familiar.<br>
"Would you like to talk about the 'Devil’s Justice' that I just explained?"<br>
It was definitely true.<br>
He is the 'Reclining Dragon' who came to the 'Recycling Center' as an evaluator.<br>
It was Zhuge Gongming.<br>
"Student Kim Dokja."<br>
I took a deep breath and started talking.<br>
"The Demon King refers to the corrupted constellations that abandoned their own scenarios and polluted the scenario region to establish their own realm."<br>
I was talking without even knowing what I was talking about.<br>
How much was that noise?<br>
[You have satisfied the unique settings for that person.]<br>
[The world view gives you 500 coins.]<br>
Satisfied the unique settings? What does it mean?<br>
Teacher Waryong shook his head as if impressed.<br>
"It’s pretty good. Well, even in inferior classes, not all are at the same level. Now, that’s it for today’s class. Everyone, prepare well for the graduation exam—"<br>
The ding-dong music rang out, and the children who were lying face down on their desks stood up all at once.<br>
Meanwhile, there were children coming towards me. These were all faces I had never seen before.<br>
"Wow, how do you memorize it all? Even though I heard it, I don’t understand a thing."<br>
"Hee, it feels like a hit."<br>
"You idiot, this isn’t power, it’s hiding knowledge."<br>
I looked at them quietly and cautiously opened my mouth.<br>
"Who are you—"<br>
Tsk tsk tsk tsk!<br>
[You made a statement that is not appropriate for the person in question!]<br>
I almost screamed at the lightly bouncing sparks.<br>
[Warning. The 'Memory Loss' setting does not exist for you.]<br>
It wasn't until I received one message after another that I began to understand little by little what the situation was.<br>
[A new scenario has arrived.]<br>
+<br>
<Main Scenario #20 – Graduation><br>
Category: Main<br>
Difficulty: ???<br>
Clear Condition: You have joined the old story according to the contract with the 'Recycling Center'. Solve the scenario by finding the clear conditions for that world view.<br>
Time limit: 15 days<br>
Reward: Fragment of the Oldest Dream, ???<br>
Failure: —<br>
+<br>
While reading the scenario, I thought of Euphrosyne's voice.<br>
「Reenactment of an old story.」<br>
Apparently, this stage seemed to be a system that imitated the Island of the Reincarnated — the ' Island'.<br>
The problem is that the genre is a little different from back then.<br>
—Kim Dokja, 3rd grade, 2nd class. Kim Dokja, 3rd grade, 2nd class, go to the teacher’s office immediately…<br>
I jumped up from my seat and headed into the hallway. As I walked down the hallway, I carefully observed the passing scenery.<br>
First of all, this stage did not have a particularly unusual worldview. Judging from the fact that the terms constellation, demon king, and scenario are also used the same way, it seems to share a worldview with the <Star Stream>.<br>
Just look at my name.<br>
Judging by the fact that my name was still 'Kim Dokja', this worldview seemed closer to a kind of 'arranged worldview' rather than possession.<br>
For example, I am called 'Kim Dokja' just like on the outside, but my settings have been changed to fit this worldview.<br>
Looking at the students' reactions, it seems like I am a kind of brain character.<br>
[Explore the clear conditions for the scenario.]<br>
As with the Gourmet Association's 『Bracelets Expedition』, this scenario is probably not the beginning of the world view.<br>
In short, it may be the time before an important event like .<br>
—Third year graduation exam.<br>
I quietly looked at the promotional flyer posted on the bulletin board.<br>
"Oh, it’s Kim Dokja,  s."<br>
Students passing by me bowed their heads and said hello. S, I can’t remember the last time I heard that word.<br>
There were people waiting for me in front of the teacher’s office.<br>
"Dokja-ssi! You’re here! Ugegege!"<br>
"Sein-ssi, if you say something like that here, there will be repercussions—gegegegege!"<br>
I don't know how many genres there are in this world, but at least one thing seems certain.<br>
"Kim Dokja, if this continues, our class will not be able to take the graduation exam."<br>
We became students of the 'Academy'.

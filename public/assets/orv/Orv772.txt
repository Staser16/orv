772 Episode 34 Sibling (3)<br>
[150,000 coins were obtained as a fee for using the original work.]<br>
As I watched the coins coming in in real time, the corners of my mouth twitched without me realizing it.<br>
Come to think of it, Kim Dokja also made money by selling Han Sooyoung's novels.<br>
Did Kim Dokja feel this way at that time?<br>
—Author. Why are you grinning?<br>
'It's no big deal.'<br>
I felt strange.<br>
This is because I had no idea that the <Star Stream> would settle something like 'original work royalties'.<br>
In reality, I only signed a lot of contracts for various things, but I almost never received proper royalties  using the original work...<br>
—Is it good?<br>
When I raised my head, I saw the shadow of a dokkaebi swaying high in the dark sky.<br>
—Do you like it? This time I paid special attention.<br>
I smiled bitterly.<br>
As expected, Bihyung had a hand in it.<br>
—I have also completed discussions with the 'Recycling Center Director'. Instead of borrowing your world view, pay you an incentive...<br>
'Thank you, but shouldn't you have gotten my permission before using it?'<br>
—Huh? What are you talking about? I got permission.<br>
Allow? No, it's my work. Who on earth did you get permission from?<br>
At that moment, someone's name came to mind. Anyone except me can sell my copyright without permission.<br>
—Your friend sponsor said before that he could exchange this for coins and signed a contract with us.<br>
This damn sponsor.<br>
—Anyway, that’s how it happened, so cheer up. I'm going again.<br>
'Wait! Is that the answer? What else did my sponsor  sell?'<br>
Unfortunately, there was no reply from Bihyung.<br>
I took a quick breath and applied it to the situation. There is no way it can be done this way. If this is his plan, I have no choice but to use it to the best of my ability.<br>
I quickly purchased items that I could use right now from the 'Dokkaebi’s Bag'.<br>
[You have completed purchasing the item.]<br>
At that moment, a change occurred in the battlefield.<br>
[Kahahahaha! This is fun!]<br>
Meanwhile, the number of high-level demons jumping into the battlefield increased.<br>
There were two people I cherished, but now there are four, five, no... six?<br>
[Hey, let’s eat delicious food together.]<br>
Currently, the core weapons of Goo Seonah's team are the 'Holy Lion Set' and the holy sword worn by Goo Seonah herself, 'Light Wish'.<br>
The 'Holy Messenger Set' was a supply specialized for defense, and the 'Light Wish' was a kind of buff item.<br>
In other words, there was no item that could cause damage to high-level demons.<br>
"What are these ? Why don’t they die!"<br>
Kim Namwoon, who was embarrassed, repeatedly swung his knife, but unfortunately, the attribute of [Black Flame] was unable to deliver an effective blow to the high-level demon.<br>
To make matters worse, the durability of the 'Holy Messenger Set' was slowly decreasing. As the high-level demons joined forces in an instant and poured out repeated attacks, cracks began to appear in various places in the 'Holy Lion Armor' that could not withstand the blows.<br>
"It’s hard to hold on any longer!"<br>
Goo Seonah bit her lip at Lee Hyunsung’s shout. It was time to make a decision. Will she sacrifice them and run away, or will she reveal all her might and fight the demons?<br>
Needless to say, it was the latter for me. That was because, although they were at a disadvantage in terms of power, they were not absolutely inferior.<br>
Above all, her team had Jung Heewon, the 'Judge of Destruction'.<br>
'Judge of Destruction' is a trait that exerts absolute power against monsters.<br>
Since 'advanced demons' also fall into the category of monsters, it was naturally right to actively hire Jung Heewon at this point.<br>
"Jung Heewon. Forward.<br>
As expected, Goo Seonah put Jung Heewon forward.<br>
"Yes."<br>
At Goo Seonah's command, Jung Heewon, wearing the leader's armband, stepped forward.<br>
I felt sick watching Jung Heewon obediently listen to her, but I guess this will solve the crisis.<br>
As long as the rest, led by Jung Heewon, who activated [Time of Judgment], provide good assistance—<br>
"Every else goes to the 'source'."<br>
What?<br>
"Chairman, no! Then—"<br>
"Lee Hyunsung. This is the best."<br>
"I can’t leave my colleagues behind. Then Heewon-ssi—"<br>
As expected, in the 41st round, Lee Hyunsung was Lee Hyunsung.<br>
But Goo Seonah’s voice was cold.<br>
"It’s an order."<br>
Goo Seonah made her choice. She said that she would give up Jung Heewon instead of quickly killing the 73rd Demon King.<br>
It was a choice that I could not understand at all.<br>
Jung Heewon is a damage dealer who is effective until the final battle of the scenario. Even if you think about it economically, it was never a card to be discarded here.<br>
Then a thought occurred to me.<br>
[The exclusive skill 'Character List' is activated!]<br>
+<br>
Character: Jung Heewon<br>
Potential: S<br>
Core settings: Leading team (S+), Kendo club (A+)<br>
Description: A being responsible for class A's justice. She basically follows the student council president's orders, but subconsciously has an aversion to her orders.<br>
She sometimes has a habit of looking blankly out the window as if she is looking for something.<br>
+<br>
Only then did I understand why Goo Seonah abandoned Jung Heewon.<br>
Is it. Did she decide that if she was someone she couldn't control, it would be better to leave her here?<br>
Jung Heewon, clutching the sword I gave her, 'Mikazuki Munechika', spoke in a voice full of determination.<br>
"You go first, Chairman."<br>
[Character Jung Heewon's characteristic 'Leader (S+)' is strongly activated!]<br>
"Thank you, leader."<br>
Kim Namwoon, who lightly tapped her on the shoulder, moved first, followed by Lee Jihye.<br>
Lee Hyunsung, who hesitated, closed his eyes tightly and turned back.<br>
"I’m sorry. Please come back."<br>
I wondered if that was a scene that made sense.<br>
Only Shin Yoosoung lingered until the end, unable to easily leave her place.<br>
"Ahhh."<br>
The moment Shin Yoosoung, who was looking at Jung Heewon with a helpless expression, stretched out her hand.<br>
Tsutsutsu.<br>
With a light spark, the light in Shin Yoosoung's eyes went out. Afterwards, the child started following Goo Seonah like a mechanical doll.<br>
This made it clear.<br>
Goo Seonah has the skill to control 'characters'.<br>
[Chase them.]<br>
Three high-ranking demons chased after Goo Seonah's team, which was quickly moving away.<br>
However, the remaining three were stranded by Jung Heewon.<br>
There were two guys that didn't follow because they were too lazy. The other one seemed to be interested in Jung Heewon.<br>
[It's not a fragment, but it's still quite interesting.]<br>
He was the one holding Yoo Jonghyuk’s spear, 'Wolgeuk'.<br>
[It would be okay for a little entertainment.]<br>
Jung Heewon created magic without saying a word.<br>
Confrontation with high-level demons.<br>
If it was an ordinary incarnation, it wouldn't have been surprising if her mind collapsed the moment she met them, but Jung Heewon was different.<br>
Jung Heewon, who activated [Kendo] in [], let out a roar and swung her sword towards the upper-class demon.<br>
She lightly swung her weapon and the demon who was struck by the sword laughed.<br>
[The constellation 'Spear Master' bursts into flames.]<br>
Damn it.<br>
After all, the opponent is that guy.<br>
The 'Spear Master' was a constellation from the <First Murim> who built his reputation by repeatedly stabbing for hundreds of years.<br>
In other rounds, it was a great-grade constellation, but here he seemed to have been raised to -grade.<br>
It looks like his status has been boosted by absorbing 'Kim Dokja Fragments'.<br>
Coo coo coo coo coo.<br>
However, since the opponent was wearing the mask of a high-class demon, Jung Heewon had a chance of winning.<br>
[Character 'Jung Heewon' requests the activation of 'Time of Judgment'!]<br>
She is the 'Judge of Destruction'.<br>
As long as [Time of Judgment] is activated, there is a chance of victory no matter who the opponent is.<br>
[Skill activation has been forcibly canceled!]<br>
Jung Heewon, startled, looked up into space.<br>
[Judge of Destruction] is a skill that can be activated only when a certain number of constellations in the channel provide probability.<br>
However, the constellations that currently occupy the channel are the <Zodiac> and the Gourmet Association. There was no constellation that would take her side.<br>
[Where can I get it?]<br>
The storm of magical power that rose from Wolgeuk poured down on Jung Heewon. The 'Holy Lion Armor' worn by Jung Heewon shattered, and sharp magical blades cut through her entire body.<br>
If things continue that way, Jung Heewon will die.  no time to hesitate.<br>
I activated [Ways of the Wind] with all my might and launched myself at Jung Heewon.<br>
At the same time, explosive spider webs poured out from my entire body.<br>
[What—]<br>
The feet of three demons, including the 'Spear Master', were tied up in [Arachne's Web]. I quickly picked up Jung Heewon, who had fallen through the bushes.<br>
Surprised, Jung Heewon widened her eyes. Soon, venom filled her eyes.<br>
"Let go."<br>
Jung Heewon's body was already in shambles. She was a master at dealing with high-level demons at the head of the group.<br>
"It’s the chairman’s order. I—"<br>
Determination to carry out orders at all costs.<br>
[The person in question is in a state of 'hypnotic instigation'.]<br>
Is that so?<br>
I expected it. Because at this point, the skills to control the characters are set.<br>
'Hypnotic instigation by hypnotist Christina Page'.<br>
Goo Seonah has already murdered other readers and obtained their skills.<br>
There were many ways to awaken [Hypnotic Incite].<br>
One of them is to awaken people with words more powerful than [Hypnotic Incite].<br>
「With Cheon Inho’s [Incite], it is possible.」<br>
I activated [Incite] without hesitation.<br>
"Heewon-ssi! Wake up!"<br>
[The person in question is under special 'hypnosis'.]<br>
[Stronger 'incite' than usual is needed.]<br>
What?<br>
[Select a 'keyword' that will be of great shock to the person in question.]<br>
Before I knew it, Jung Heewon, with a straight face, thrust the blade of Munechika Mikazuki at my neck.<br>
"Put me down."<br>
I thought about Jung Heewon.<br>
What should I say to shock this person?<br>
「"Inho-ssi, you’re a bit of a strange person. You only say strange things."」<br>
In the main story, the woman who was the sword that protected Kim Dokja.<br>
「"Inho-ssi, how did you become a writer?"」<br>
It already occurred to me that the relationship I had built with her was not short. We hunted ichthyosaurs together, cleared Geumho Station, Chungmuro, and the theater dungeon. We fought against the beggars at Seoul Station and defeated the monsters at Gwanghwamun.<br>
「"Inho-ssi."」<br>
Will those times also become a story one day? How much history must be accumulated before it becomes a story?<br>
I don't know. However, what I remember is only one sentence.<br>
「"Don’t die."」<br>
Jung Heewon always saved me with that one sentence. And now it was my turn to return the sentence.<br>
—Writer! I can't hold on any longer!<br>
There was a figure chasing after me along with Ji Eunyu's screams.<br>
I carried Jung Heewon on my back and reflexively lowered  head. The sharp force of the spear grazed my hair and lodged in the tree.<br>
There was nowhere to run now.<br>
If we don't wake up Jung Heewon now, we will all die here.<br>
So, I feel sorry for Jung Heewon, but here I had no choice but to say something that Jung Heewon would hate to hear.<br>
"Heewon-ssi, I love you!"<br>
This.<br>
I thought it would be okay.<br>
Obviously, she heard something similar on the subway at that time and her expression didn't look good—<br>
[The character 'Jung Heewon' is strongly agitated by your remarks.]<br>
"You… are you suddenly talking nonsense? In this situation…"<br>
Her face was distorted with anger, but Jung Heewon's hypnosis was not broken.<br>
No, this doesn't work?<br>
In the meantime, a high-ranking demon, swinging the moon like a windmill, rushed in.<br>
As I put Jung Heewon down on the floor, I took out 'Unbreakable Faith' and swung it around. There was a heavy sibilant sound and the pain of my wrist being bent.<br>
[You—]<br>
The spear master's eyes widened as he recognized me.<br>
[You are a very large fragment.]<br>
Changgeuk was moving to a state that was difficult to follow with my eyes.<br>
Damn, was I wrong?<br>
I took out one of the items I had purchased earlier from my pocket.<br>
[Use the item 'Commercial Signal Flare'!]<br>
A signal that explodes like a firecracker. I can only hope that my colleagues will check this signal in time.<br>
"Jung Heewon-ssi! Run away!"<br>
I shouted with all my might towards Jung Heewon.<br>
"I will stop this place somehow—"<br>
I desperately activated [Way of the Wind], but it was an unavoidable blow. I felt a sharp spear tearing through the skin of my stomach.<br>
I guess so. Because this is not an enemy I can defeat in my current state.<br>
[Smile?]<br>
Nevertheless, I was smiling while holding on to the pole of his spear.<br>
I thought it was a good thing.<br>
"Jung Heewon-ssi! Quick—"<br>
Why? Jung Heewon had no answer.<br>
I looked back. Jung Heewon was still there. She didn't run away, she just stood there looking at me.<br>
[The character 'Jung Heewon' is greatly shocked.]<br>
It was only at that moment that I realized.<br>
A 'keyword' that can wake up Jung Heewon.<br>
"Ah—"<br>
The moment I saw Jung Heewon's expression, strangely enough, my sponsor came to mind.<br>
「The Demon King of Salvation.」<br>
I now understand why a man who was so inexperienced at saving others was called the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
[The character 'Jung Heewon’s' mind temporarily collapses!]<br>
Anyone who is saved by the Demon King will inevitably suffer irreversible damage.<br>
"Don’t die, don’t die, don’t die—"<br>
Jung Heewon, muttering like crazy, staggered closer.<br>
Blood poured out from the skin of my stomach that  by Changgeuk, and my consciousness gradually faded.<br>
And as my consciousness faded, a strong confidence filled me.<br>
[A constellation that has not yet revealed its modifier is watching you.]<br>
Jung Heewon will not die.<br>
[The clouded consciousness is partially liberated from the restraints of the body.]<br>
She will suffer injuries so terrible that she will , but she will not die.<br>
[Level 3 of the exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is forcibly activated.]<br>
And there will be a one-sided atonement from the Demon King for this one-sided salvation.<br>
It's reading stories of hurt people.<br>
Read, read, read again.<br>
['First-person Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' is activated!]<br>
Finally becoming that person.<br>
"You can’t die."<br>
When I opened my eyes, I saw my incarnation body falling.<br>
"No matter what happens, I will definitely save you."<br>
A high-level demon was holding its hand toward my head with greedy eyes.<br>
I moved Jung Heewon’s hand and grabbed 'Mikazuki Munechika'.<br>
['Time of Judgment' is activated!]<br>
[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation (acting agent)' has agreed to the activation of 'Time of Judgment'.]

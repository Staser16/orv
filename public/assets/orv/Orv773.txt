773 Episode 34 Sibling (4)<br>
The condition for activating [Time of Judgment] of the Ten Demon Judges is simple.<br>
「Get support from constellations within the same channel.」<br>
The important thing here is that not all 'constellations within the same channel' need to agree.<br>
Unlike the 'Judge of 's' [Time of Judgment], which does not activate even if only one of the 'Absolute Good' constellations opposes it, the [Time of Judgment] of the 'Judge of Destruction' can be activated even if only one constellation agrees.<br>
[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation (Agent)' has agreed to the activation of the Time of Judgment.]<br>
In other words, [Time of Judgment] can be activated even if there is only one constellation that agrees within the channel.<br>
[The constellation 'Plague Rat' opposes the activation of 'Time of Judgment'!]<br>
[The constellation 'Serpent Cutting Its Tail' opposes the activation of 'Time of Judgment'!]<br>
[The constellation 'dog that threw itself into the flames' opposes the activation of 'Time of Judgment'!]<br>
As expected, there was opposition from the beggars. But there is no use in opposing it.<br>
I agree, so what are you going to do?<br>
['Time of Judgment' begins!]<br>
[The constellation 'rat that brings plague' opens its eyes!]<br>
[The constellation 'the snake cutting off its tail' cannot hide its embarrassment.]<br>
It felt good to see the astonished constellations, but in fact, it was not a very favorable situation for us.<br>
「The characteristics of the three great judges all have something in common: they borrow the probability of 'constellations'.」<br>
The judge judges the object on behalf of the will of the constellations, and the constellations pay an appropriate probability.<br>
The problem was the probability.<br>
[Currently, there is only one constellation within the channel that has agreed to the time of judgment.]<br>
[There is insufficient probability.]<br>
[The of 'Time of Judgment' is low.]<br>
'Judgment of Ten Demons' is easy to activate [Time of Judgment], its effect greatly depends on the level or number of people who agree to activate the skill.<br>
In short, right now, Jung Heewon could only borrow the probability of the 'Demon King of Salvation (agent)'.<br>
Tsk tsk, tsk tsk.<br>
Surely the skill won't end before she even fights properly?<br>
A high-level demon holding the 'Wolgeuk'—the 'Spear Master' muttered while holding Jung Heewon’s collar.<br>
[Interesting. I never thought there would be an incarnation with the 'judge' trait.]<br>
I spoke to that guy using Jung Heewon’s words.<br>
"The level of the Gourmet Association has fallen a lot. They even accept lowly  great-grade like you as  'Gourmet Association' members."<br>
[Are you crazy?]<br>
Looking at his expression, it seemed like I had really touched the point.<br>
I guess so. In fact, these guys are probably not mainstream 'Gourmet Association' members, but rather subcontractors.<br>
For example, this means that these are the people who supply items such as the 'Heart of a 10th Circle Grand Mage' or 'The Right Arm of a Poor Sword Master' that are being eaten up by the Gourmet Association.<br>
[Something like a kid with no background—]<br>
"Are you ignoring the Demon King of Salvation?"<br>
Without hesitation, I put my strength on my back foot. As expected from a born swordsman, her muscle movements were extraordinary.<br>
The 'Spear Master' gave an order as if he was annoyed by the rapidly narrowing distance.<br>
[Block it.]<br>
Two high-level demons who had been loitering in the back stepped forward as if they had been waiting.<br>
[Master of intestines, how dare you order me?]<br>
[I was already planning on eating her!]<br>
One guy seems to have a  pouch and appears to be a typical assassin.<br>
And the other one was wearing battle gauntlets, so it was a martial arts style.<br>
It was the assassin who moved first. The guy with his cheeks puffed out like a frog spewed green poisonous smoke, creating a swamp around him.<br>
[Advanced demon 'Filth Addict' activates 'Pollution Zone Lv.10'!]<br>
Filth addict.<br>
Was this guy there too?<br>
This constellation was originally one of the guys who followed Yoo Jonghyuk like a stalker in the middle rounds of 'Ways of Survival'.<br>
His battle logic is to restrict the opponent's movement by laying down a contaminated area and then shoot the enemy with an extremely poisonous needle to subdue the enemy.<br>
[It looks good to squeeze!]<br>
This guy, who likes to hunt prey with minimal injury, had an eccentric hobby of squeezing out freshly caught prey and eating its contents.<br>
Coincidentally, in 'Ways of Survival', there is a scene where Yoo Jonghyuk subdues that guy.<br>
To explain it in Yoo Jonghyuk style, the method is as follows.<br>
「One, do not step on 'contaminated areas'  protruding tree trunks as a stepping stone.」<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk's 'combat textbook' is difficult for Cheon Inho to follow.<br>
But what about 'Jung Heewon'?<br>
[You’re a quick guy!]<br>
The moment I jumped into the air to avoid the contaminated area, it shot something out of its mouth again.<br>
「Two, avoid the 'extremely poisonous needle' flying from the air.」<br>
An 'extremely poisonous needle' that cuts off half of your combat ability for 10 minutes with just one hit. It was a key skill that allowed the 'filth addict' with low combat power to maintain his position as a constellation.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Way of the Wind' is activated!]<br>
Of course, it doesn't work for me.<br>
The moment the frightened filth addict widened his eyes, I spun around in the air, accelerated, and swung my sword at him.<br>
[Pathetic guy. Go away!]<br>
The one who blocked the sword was a martial arts-style high-level demon who narrowly came forward.<br>
[Advanced demon 'Wingak Taoist' unleashes his power!]<br>
Like the 'Spear Master', he was a constellation from the <First Murim>.<br>
「A person who was once a master in his twenties of the <First Martial Arts>, but sold his clan and martial arts to Seongun and was given the position of 'constellation'.」<br>
Seeing that he is still living as a subcontractor for the 'Gourmet Association', his habits as a human do not change even if he became a Constellation.<br>
[Maesonga, take it! This is the 'Hundred !]<br>
Of course, it wasn't [Hundred ]. The real Hundred  is not that shabby.<br>
[This is a martial arts skill that brought even the Breaking the Sky Sword Saint to her knees!]<br>
If Breaking the Sky Sword Saint were here,  a sound that would make one's head fly off at once.<br>
But there was no Breaking the Sky Sword Saint here, and it was only Jung Heewon and I who had to deal with him.<br>
In the face of the  of power that took over the place in an instant, I frantically took a step back.<br>
Fast.<br>
No matter how constrained the opponent was by the scenario constraints, a constellation was a constellation, and at one time,  was a strong man who was listed as one of the 20 strongest members of <The First Murim>.<br>
But it's worth a try.<br>
A trajectory that Cheon Inho could not follow was visible.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Kendo Lv.10' is activated!]<br>
Being visible means that there is an opportunity to counterattack as long as the body's abilities are supported.<br>
Gooooooo!<br>
Jung Heewon's [Kendo], which has already surpassed the level<br>
of transcendence, is filled with the power of swords. A talent who her sword skills alone and would have undoubtedly competed for the place of the best in the world if she were in the <First Murim>.<br>
The moment the lost guard Kwongak took his breath, Jung Heewon and I were already right in front of him.<br>
[What—]<br>
The sharp sword energy drew a brilliant trajectory to the guy's fist.<br>
[Kaaaaaa—!]<br>
What I can do is utilize all of Jung Heewon's potential while [Time of Judgment] lasts.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Demon Slayer Lv.10' is activated!]<br>
Red natural flowers flickered at the corners of my eyes, and explosive power welled up.<br>
I held 'Mikazuki Munechika' with both hands and swung it again and again.<br>
From top to bottom and from left to right again.<br>
"You—!"<br>
The wrist of the unguarded Kwongak Taoist flew into the air.<br>
I didn't miss the opportunity and  his arms.<br>
[Some constellations are astonished by the fighting power of incarnation 'Jung Heewon'!]<br>
The sound of flesh being torn apart.<br>
The panicked Taoist swordsman held onto Munechika Mikazuki's blade with one hand and unleashed a barrage of punches with the other hand.<br>
[You dare!]<br>
There was no place to escape unless I let go of the sword. A blow that would explode one's body with just one hit.<br>
Still, I didn't let go of the sword. I believed in Jung Heewon’s .<br>
[Exclusive attribute 'Mad Butcher' activates!]<br>
Her indomitable trait that made her enter the '100 Strongest People' of the Ways of Survival came into play.<br>
Kuddddddd!<br>
Jung Heewon’s body was not broken even by the pouring power. The aura surrounding her entire body burned even more fiercely.<br>
The moment the 'Gwongak Taoist' screamed, Jung Heewon's sword moved once again. In addition, it is a sword strike imbued with the ability of [Time of Judgment].<br>
「"I have to become stronger."」<br>
On top of that, there is the time that Jung Heewon has accumulated so far.<br>
「"I have to swing faster and stronger."」<br>
I was able to find out  Jung Heewon was thinking of when practicing swordsmanship.<br>
It was the most beautiful swordI had ever seen.<br>
「"Only then can I protect Inho-ssi."」<br>
Jung Heewon swung her sword again and again to catch up with him.<br>
[Uh, how could it be that the only human in the scenario is—]<br>
Each and every sword swung like that came together and finally came together at Jung Heewon's fingertips.<br>
A level that an ordinary human being can never reach. A wall that even martial arts masters cannot overcome even after training for hundreds of years.<br>
The wall was crumbling in the face of overwhelming talent.<br>
「Transcendent type level 1.」<br>
A sword made to break the sword of the King.<br>
Her kendo blossomed into a brilliant beam of light, splitting the incarnation body of the 'Wingak Taoist' in half.<br>
[High-ranking demon 'Wingak Taoist' has been killed!]<br>
[The constellation 'Wingak Taoist' receives a terrible shock and leaves the scenario!]<br>
It was impossible.<br>
Even though this is the twentieth scenario, it is a feat in which an incarnation with no sponsor defeats an incarnation possessed by a great-grade constellation.<br>
[The constellations belonging to the Chinese Zodiac are greatly shocked by the power of the incarnation 'Jung Heewon'!]<br>
[The constellations of the Gourmet Association mak interested expressions!]<br>
[A constellation whose modifier has not yet been revealed is watching your battle.]<br>
[5,000 coins were sponsored.]<br>
[The battle of incarnation 'Jung Heewon' is leaked outside the 'Recycling Center' through the management bureau!]<br>
There was no time to get drunk on the joy of victory. Jung Heewon’s body was rapidly becoming heavier.<br>
[There is not enough probability to continue the 'Time of Judgment'.]<br>
[After a while, the reaction of 'madness' will begin.]<br>
Without stopping, I swung my sword at the 'filth addict' next to me.<br>
There are two demons remaining.  I could move her body at all, I had to kill all the remaining guys.<br>
However, the 'filth addict', who foresaw his colleague's defeat, was already running away.<br>
[Damn it! I’ve never heard of such a monster!]<br>
Eventually, there was only one demon left.<br>
[How pathetic. The title 'Gourmet Association' is a waste, Guru Kwon Gak.]<br>
The spear master was glaring at me with cool eyes, as if he wasn't too shaken by my battle.<br>
And the next moment, the spear master’s new form disappeared.<br>
I swung my sword reflexively.<br>
'Mikazuki Munechika' broke with a deep sibilant sound.<br>
The powerful force emitted by the spear master destroyed Jung Heewon's sword and touched the blade of 'Mikazuki Munechika'.<br>
A rapid spear attack followed.<br>
Although it was frustrating, the 'spear master'’s skills were real.<br>
Unlike the Kwongak master who sold out his sect to Seongun and became a 'constellation', this guy was truly a constellation who achieved great feats with his own skills.<br>
In an instant, blood spurted out from the damaged body.<br>
['Time of Judgment' ends.]<br>
To make matters worse, [Time of Judgment] has also ended.<br>
Terrible pain radiated from every bone in my body. All I could really do now was stand.<br>
The spear master was smiling as if he had already secured victory.<br>
[It’s an amazing talent. If you had trained for ten more years, we could have had an interesting match.]<br>
"If it had been one more minute, you would have passed out."<br>
This is it.<br>
By reducing the three high-level demons to one, the goal was achieved.<br>
[I only kept my mouth shut because I thought you were going to die soon.]<br>
The spear master's eyes scanned the entire body of Jung Heewon, whom I had possessed.<br>
[It is a very desirable incarnation. If you want to live, I will give you a chance. If you become my 'incarnation'…]<br>
The expression of the spear master who had been speaking so far hardened.<br>
The reason was clear.<br>
A roar heard from afar. Something was running towards us like a tank, plowing through the forest road.<br>
A pitch-black coat blowing in the wind.<br>
If Han Sooyoung were here, she would definitely have said this.<br>
「"◼️Ba, as expected, the main character."」<br>
I spoke to the high-ranking demon in a triumphant voice, like a fox riding on a tiger's back.<br>
"It’s been a minute, kid."<br>
The eyes of Yoo Jonghyuk, who came running out of breath, were looking in this direction.<br>
It was clear what the guy saw to ran to us.<br>
He must have read the phrase on the 'commercial signal flare' I fired earlier.<br>
「Here is a demon king with your 'spear'.」<br>
'Wolgeuk' is Yoo Jonghyuk’s decisive battle weapon for the 41st round.<br>
From my perspective, it was a stroke of luck that the 'spear master' obtained the Wolgeuk.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk! Here we are!"<br>
I shouted with all my might in Jung Heewon’s voice.<br>
"Here is the villain of the world who stole your spear—"<br>
The 'Spear Master' is a monster that should never be dealt with under normal circumstances, but with Yoo Jonghyuk in the '41st round', it was an enemy worth fighting.<br>
If the two of them calmly form a formation to stop them and kill them—<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk?"<br>
But Yoo Jonghyuk was looking somewhere else without even looking in my direction.<br>
If he had seen that expression on his face, he would definitely have said this.<br>
「"Isn’t that the look you make when you go to buy dumplings and there aren’t any left?"」

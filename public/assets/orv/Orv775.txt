75 Episode 35 Demon King Qualifications (1)<br>
A chill passed over the nape of my neck.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' frowns.]<br>
It started with 'Heir of the Eternal Name'.<br>
[The story 'Recorder of Things that will Disappear' expresses sorrow.]<br>
[The story 'One Who Rewrites Fate' gazes at fate.]<br>
The stories I possessed were reacting to that being. It was warning me.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' expresses hatred.]<br>
To eliminate that being in front of me.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' says that name is for only one person.]<br>
If I leave that being alone, it will threaten me.<br>
But I shook my head.<br>
"If you can't control stories, you will live according to the stories' will."<br>
More than anything, I knew who that 'Kim Dokja' was.<br>
"Goo Seonah-ssi." The moment I called her name, a loud thunder rumbled in the sky.<br>
Was someone else in the distance overdoing the probability?<br>
A pitch-black darkness was flowing out from the sky that was cracked as if it would break at any moment.<br>
[The probability constraints of the scenario weaken.]<br>
In any case, it  for me.<br>
[The worldview turns its eyes to the probability collision area.]<br>
As the worldview constraints weakened, the restrictions on speech loosened. Now, I could have a free conversation with Goo Seonah.<br>
"Goo Seonah-ssi. Let's stop now."<br>
Goo Seonah. I recalled the information I knew about her. There might be some clue left inside me that could convince her.<br>
Her ID is strawberry1137.<br>
Reader level 46.<br>
Reading count 8 times.<br>
Judging from her ID, she's probably someone who likes strawberries. 1137 might be some kind of anniversary.<br>
For example, March 7th of the 11th year. I shook my head. This wasn't enough. I needed more information about her.<br>
[Use 'Reader Comment List' on the person.]<br>
+<br>
* You can check the comments written by the reader using coins.<br>
* Currently, there are 3 comments that can be checked for free.<br>
+<br>
A skill that I didn't use often because I felt uncomfortable looking at other people's comments. But now, there was no other way.<br>
When I activated the skill, the comments she had left came to mind one by one.<br>
+<br>
No, does this make sense? No matter what, it makes sense to split the reader in half? This is really the author's fault.<br>
—(Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, Chapter 516)<br>
+<br>
He's back, right? He's back, right? He's back? She smiled brightly! Sooyoung can't be so bright if it's not the case! —(Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Chapter 551)<br>
+<br>
I recently told my friend about this novel.. He said it was fun.. Happy...<br>
—(Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint, Chapter 551)<br>
+<br>
Somehow it didn’t feel real.<br>
I thought of Goo Seonah I saw in Chungmuro. Her expression was somehow poisonous and her eyes were strong. She didn’t trust people easily.<br>
The Goo Seonah in the Internet comment window was different from the Goo Seonah I knew. Her comments were lively, her joy and sadness were clear, and I couldn’t sense even a shadow.<br>
I read and reread the last comment she wrote. Then, a conversation suddenly came to mind.<br>
To be exact, it wasn’t my memory, but the memory of the acting person 'Kim Kyungsik' that I had absorbed.<br>
In my memory, the two of them were sitting on the platform in Chungmuro ​​and chatting away.<br>
The memory was damaged, so I couldn’t hear most of the conversation well, but I could hear a few words from Goo Seonah clearly.<br>
「"There's someone I need to find."」<br>
Goo Seonah's expression as she said those words was also vivid.<br>
「"If I possessed someone in this world, that guy would definitely be here too."」<br>
Maybe this is why I can't ignore her.<br>
Her life is not here. So I have a duty to send her back to her own world. I've always thought that way.<br>
"Goo Seonah, what on earth have you done?"<br>
Goo Seonah, whose eyes met mine, had a face that was even more like 'Kim Dokja' than 'Jung-chul'.<br>
She tilted her head with a subtle smile.<br>
Her gaze fell on the floor. There were the mortal bodies of the incarnations that were limp.<br>
I've never talked to them directly, but they were all faces I knew.<br>
Students from Class A.<br>
[The constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' cries out in pain while feeling nauseous!]<br>
They were students who were the terminal incarnations of <Twelve Zodiac Signs>.<br>
[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' breaks the brick house in agony!]<br>
[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' bites his nails and goes into a seizure!]<br>
The screams of the constellations echoed in my ears.<br>
[The constellation 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' goes into a frenzy.]<br>
[The constellation 'Pig Living in a Brick House' goes into a frenzy.]<br>
[The constellation 'Nail-Eating Rat' goes into a frenzy.]<br>
Goo Seonah, who has become even more like 'Kim Dokja' than before.<br>
The incarnations that are  as if they are dead.<br>
The constellations are in pain.<br>
"I just made it easier for you."<br>
Goo Seonah was saying.<br>
"You know that too. These guys, they barely have any 'reader' egos left. So I'm going to cut out that part and put it in a bag."<br>
"Then the readers—"<br>
She smiled brightly and pointed at herself with her thumb. The intense and ominous feeling felt from her whole body,<br>
[The story 'The Master of Sim-i-ja' is out!]<br>
She had absorbed the 'Kim Dokja fragments' that the constellations of <Twelve Zodiac Signs> had.<br>
"Why are you looking at me like that? They're the ones who harassed us. You must have had a hard time because of them too."<br>
That's right. I had a hard time because of them too.<br>
In particular, when I met the 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake' in the <Twelve Zodiac Signs> scenario, I almost died.<br>
But they weren't hostile to me from the beginning.<br>
The 'Tiger Eating Rice Cake', the 'Pig Living in a Brick House', and the '' were the same.<br>
At Geumho Station, at Chungmuro ​​Station, and even during 'The .'<br>
They were the constellations who cheered me on the most. Maybe that's why I was always reluctant to confront them sincerely.<br>
Even if they had almost no 'Reader' soul left, even if only 1 percent of the soul fragments remained, it was okay. For that 1 percent, I could have thrown myself at them over and over again to save them.<br>
But.<br>
"I just did what you did. We're the same."<br>
I unconsciously took a step back as I watched Goo Seonah calmly spread her arms.<br>
"So let's just be one, Kim Dokja."<br>
Until now, I believed that there was a minimum level of good. I wanted to believe that she would at least not touch the same 'reader'.<br>
But she crossed that line as if it were a joke.<br>
"You're really good at talking like Nirvana."<br>
It was only one step.<br>
In that one step, Goo Seonah's white hand, which had come close to my nose, reached out toward my neck.<br>
I reflexively swung my 'Unbreakable Faith' and swatted her hand away. Even though it hit her hand, there was a sharp, metallic sound.<br>
Her entire hand was shining like a fresh fingernail.<br>
I looked into the story.<br>
The story of the 'nail-eating rat'— 「The cornered fingernail」. A story that strengthens a part of the body to a level close to a sacred relic.<br>
I swung my sword once more. Her nails and the sword clashed several times, and the magical power that came into contact was canceled out and turned into a loud noise. Judging from the level of recoil, the amount of magical power and physical strength that each of us had were similar.<br>
Goo Seonah smiled brightly.<br>
"I will kill the 'Daemajok'. You just get out of here."<br>
"Why on earth are you doing this?"<br>
"I didn't start this. You started this."<br>
"You haven't even heard my story yet! You didn't even ask what happened between me and Kim Kyungsik-ssi, or what you saw!"<br>
Goo Seonah's nails that had been clashing fiercely stopped for the first time.<br>
"Kim Kyung-sik."<br>
I nodded.<br>
Finally, my chance to speak had come.<br>
What she saw that day was a misunderstanding, and while it's true that I absorbed Kim Kyungsik-ssi's soul, I never killed him. That's what I tried to explain.<br>
"I forgot. Did you think I was doing this because of that old man?"<br>
It wasn't because of Kim Kyungsik?<br>
Then why on earth does Goo Seonah have such strong hostility toward me?<br>
The crackling sound erupted once again, and we simultaneously took three or four steps back.<br>
Goo Seonah stared at me with clear eyes. Then she frowned as if she was displeased.<br>
"You really don't know?"<br>
"What do you mean?"<br>
"You made everything happen with this and forgot about it yourself?"<br>
Goo Seonah let out a strange laugh and raised her hand. Soon, she snapped her fingers.<br>
My heart felt cold.<br>
The soul she had absorbed, 'Christina Page's' special skill, had been activated.<br>
[Character 'Goo Seonah' activates 'Daily Corpse Lv. 10'!]<br>
[Daily Corpse] is a skill that causes the soul to separate from the body as soon as it is activated. But I have a countermeasure.<br>
「I am 'Kim Dokja' who cannot be hypnotized.」<br>
But the moment I activated [Incite], I realized something was strange.<br>
I was not the one on whom she activated [Daily Corpse].<br>
"I'll make you remember."<br>
[Character 'Goo Seonah' activates 'Hypnosis Incite Lv. 10'.]<br>
At the same time, incarnations came out from all over the bushes, trembling.<br>
They were all familiar faces.<br>
Lee Hyunsung, Lee Jihye, Kim Namwoon, and even Shin Yoosoung.<br>
Perhaps due to the influence of [Daily Corpse], the four people's eyes were empty.<br>
Lee Hyunsung moved at the same time as Goo Seonah's nod.<br>
[Character Lee Hyunsung activates 'Mountain Breaker Lv. 9'!]<br>
Lee Hyunsung's huge fist slammed into the ground. The dirt floor flipped over as if there was an earthquake, and a ringing sound was heard. While my senses were disturbed, Lee Jihye and Kim Namwoon rushed forward, piercing through the dust.<br>
Kaga River!<br>
I held 'Unbreakable Faith' and 'Sain Chamsagum' in pairs and struck back at the two's attacks. My palms were tingling from the heavy blows.<br>
Next came Shin Yoosoung. The 8th-grade sea creatures controlled by the child began to play together.<br>
['Naggak Ensemble' is starting!]<br>
However, the Naggak Ensemble was not toward me, but was rising in a completely different direction, creating dissonance.<br>
Goo Seonah frowned and said.<br>
"Shin Yoosoung, do it right."<br>
As I watched Shin Yoosoung's trembling shoulders, a strange dissonance arose in my heart as well.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' laughs brightly.]<br>
I wanted to save up some strength for the final battle. But now I had to admit it.<br>
Goo Seonah is strong. If she can control such strong characters at will, she might be considered superior to the 'higher-level demons'.<br>
She has collected that many 'Kim Dokja fragments'.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' begins its storytelling as if it had been waiting for it.]<br>
If it had been before, it would have been a power that I would have used after watching the situation. But now that the world's gaze is focused elsewhere, it would be okay.<br>
[One of the 'Demon King of Salvation's' stories awakens due to the effect of 'Heir of the Eternal Name'.]<br>
[The story '' can now be used temporarily.]<br>
Story, 『』.<br>
It was the story that the 'Demon King of Salvation' obtained after defeating the demon count 'Tentachio' in the Dark Castle.<br>
「A tale of overwhelming power when the opponent is 'weaker than you'.」<br>
Of course, Lee Hyunsung was too strong to apply this 'tale'. Kim Namwoon, Lee Jihye, and maybe even Shin Yoosoung were incarnations who could easily overwhelm me with their immediate performances.<br>
But there was something they could never surpass me.<br>
「That's the 'strength' of the real story.」<br>
Hmm, I took a deep breath and immediately put a stop to the strengh that I had been holding back.<br>
[The constellation 'Demon King of Salvation (Agent)' reveals his strength!]<br>
The movements of Lee Hyunsung and his party stopped in their tracks at the sudden release of strength.<br>
I didn't miss that moment and activated my skill.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Incite Lv.10' is activated!]<br>
In fact, I didn't want to use this skill on people I knew. But now, there was no other way.<br>
I placed my hand on Lee Hyunsung's shoulder as he rushed toward me.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Incite' is in sync with 'Insect Massacre'.]<br>
Suddenly, that thought occurred to me.<br>
Maybe dreaming isn't just about the 'oldest dream'.<br>
「This world is a huge [Incite]. All beings are just moving from one dream to another.」<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, Cheon Inho, Asmodeus, Goo Seonah, and Ye Hyunwoo. They all have their own dreams. They also fight to bring the characters to their own dreams.<br>
Perhaps, I am the same.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Incite' exerts an overwhelming influence on incarnations of lower rank than you!]<br>
However, as always, there is something you must do first to dream a new dream.<br>
"Hyunsung-ssi."<br>
Wake up from the 'old dream'.<br>
"Do you remember the trumpet sound?"<br>
Lee Hyunsung's shoulders began to shake like crazy.

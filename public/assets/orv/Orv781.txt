781 Episode 36 Real Kim Dokja (2)<br>
With a special sound, the high-level demon fell.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo retrieved the 'Kim Dokja fragment' that the high-level demon had.<br>
['Kim Dokja fragment' retrieved successfully.]<br>
The energy of the story flowing in with the message.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo checked his face reflected in the puddle. The white and pale face that he had once seen on the cover of 『Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint』. It looked a bit younger than what he had seen then. Perhaps it was because his physical age was that of a boy.<br>
「I wonder if I have become a little more Kim Dokja now.」<br>
How many more 'Kim Dokja fragments' does he have to collect to become Kim Dokja?<br>
Can he become Kim Dokja?<br>
「"If you are possessed, you must hide behind me. You hate being hurt."」<br>
A memory suddenly lingered in his ears.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo thought of the owner of the voice.<br>
'Noh Jiyoon.'<br>
The daughter of Lee Dansu ahjussi. The girl who visited 'Kim Dokja Banquet' with him.<br>
「Jiyoon is dead.」<br>
No one told him that. However, he found out naturally while collecting the 'Kim Dokja fragments'.<br>
「Everyone, get out of here! Quickly!」<br>
There was a reader who fell at the same station as Jiyoon. Jiyoon fought the monsters to save the reader and the people, and died.<br>
It wasn't that surprising in this world.<br>
The reader Jiyoon saved that day also died in the end. Torn to pieces by a high-level demon.<br>
What was the meaning of Jiyoon's sacrifice?<br>
Ye Hyunwoo couldn't quite understand it.<br>
「Just like how he couldn’t understand Kim Dokja, who risked his life for his group, while reading 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' over fifty times.」<br>
"You're right. I like being safe."<br>
Replying to his old friend's voice, Ye Hyunwoo walked around. There was no road, but he walked where he thought it was a road.<br>
He also hummed a song that his friend Jiyoon liked. As he hummed the song, memories that were still vivid enough to be called memories came back to him one after another.<br>
[The story 'Panda and Friends' begins its storytelling.]<br>
The story of persuading Gong Pildu to survive in Chungmuro.<br>
The story of developing the 'Invincible Castle Tech Tree'.<br>
The story of almost fighting Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
The story of 'capturing the flag' with the readers.<br>
The story of meeting Cheon Inho and his group.<br>
"But Jiyoon. You liked being safe, too."<br>
Disaster scenarios and Peace Land, the Washington Dome and the 'Recycling Center'.<br>
Hiding together in a brick house.<br>
Eating soup made by the crane owner.<br>
Fixing a swallow's leg or taking care of a goose in labor.<br>
Watching the group from a corner while eating bamboo.<br>
Counting each of those things, Ye Hyunwoo felt that all of those things were like a novel.<br>
Then what role was he assigned in that novel?<br>
Ye Hyunwoo's steps stopped. The forest ended and a small open space appeared.<br>
There was a demon.<br>
A man wearing a white coat and spreading his black wings.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo swallowed as he looked at the red horns sprouting from his head.<br>
[The demon '73rd Demon King' is staring at you.]<br>
The '73rd Demon King' slowly turned his back and looked at him.<br>
「Demon King of Salvation.」<br>
He had expected it since he heard that the name of the demon was '73rd Demon King'.<br>
That 'Demon King of Salvation' was here. protagonist they were looking for had appeared as their opponent.<br>
But the moment their eyes met, Ye Hyunwoo felt strange.<br>
「That's the 'Demon King of Salvation'?」<br>
He definitely felt the powerful energy of the 'Kim Dokja Fragments' from him.<br>
But...<br>
'Come to your senses.'<br>
Ye Hyunwoo shook his head several times and took a deep breath.<br>
'I have to kill him.'<br>
Since he was marked as the boss of this stage, the 'Demon King of Salvation' must have powers of a different dimension.<br>
He must not let his party face the 'Demon King of Salvation'. If he did, there would definitely be casualties. In order to prevent that, he came here before anyone else.<br>
The moment he took a deep breath and stepped into the empty space, shouts were heard from all directions. The forest in the area shook and a group of incarnations appeared.<br>
[Hit him!]<br>
The incarnations who had drawn their weapons were running towards the Demon King of Salvation.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo immediately recognized who they were. The constellations of the <Twelve Zodiac Signs>. They were the ones who had participated in the scenario with them until recently.<br>
[The constellation 'Monkey that fell from a tree' roars!]<br>
[The constellation 'Ox of the Beginning' bares its teeth!]<br>
[The constellation 'Red Divine Army' roars!]<br>
At first, it seemed like the <Twelve Zodiac Signs> were joining hands to hunt the demon.<br>
But the wave pattern felt strange. The <Twelve Zodiac Signs> he knew did not have that level of power.<br>
'It's not the Twelve Zodiac Signs'.<br>
A cold sensation passed through his heart belatedly.<br>
'Someone is using the modifiers of the <Twelve Zodiac Signs'.<br>
As if they knew the demon's weakness, the constellations equipped with divine attribute weapons swung their weapons in precise trajectories. Push shot!<br>
The demon tribe was mercilessly slaughtered by an attack that had the rank of a constellation.<br>
Looking at the staggering demon, Ye Hyunwoo's head went through complicated calculations.<br>
It might have been a good thing.<br>
The 'Demon King of Salvation' is a difficult opponent to face alone. If they wait for an opportunity here and join forces with the constellations, the scenario will be much easier.<br>
'Let's get started.'<br>
From the start of the scenario until now, Ye Hyunwoo has steadily progressed through the 'Invincible Castle Tech Tree'.<br>
The 'Invincible Castle Tech Tree' he designed has a total of 10 stages.<br>
And Ye Hyunwoo has just reached the activation condition for stage 8 of the tech tree.<br>
[Activate exclusive skill 'Magic Charge Lv. 10'.]<br>
The key to this build-up is to apply his exclusive skill, [Magic Charge] — to supply unlimited magical power to Gong Pildu, who has the strongest defense.<br>
「But there is no Gong Pildu here now.」<br>
Several constellations that felt the magical wave turned to Ye Hyunwoo.<br>
[That guy—]<br>
[Don’t worry. He is an incarnation that can’t do anything alone.]<br>
Is his weakness already known to the constellations?<br>
Ye Hyunwoo smiled bitterly.<br>
They were certainly right. He is an incarnation that can’t do anything alone.<br>
'But isn’t that the same for everyone?'<br>
Ye Hyunwoo slowly took a deep breath and gathered his magical power. It was finally time for the 'Kim Dokja Fragments' he had collected to exert their power.<br>
[The power of the new 'Kim Dokja Fragments' is activated.]<br>
[Some of the skills of 'The Oldest Dream' are restored.]<br>
The 'Invincible Castle Tech Tree' he had envisioned required 'Gong Pildu' up to stage 7.<br>
However, it was different from stage 8.<br>
[Activate exclusive skill 'Bookmark Lv.5'!]<br>
[The composition of this skill is incomplete.]<br>
[The characters that can be listed in the bookmark list are limited.]<br>
[Bookmark].<br>
A skill that is exclusive to Kim Dokja and can borrow the power of a 'character'.<br>
It is currently extremely incomplete, so only one 'character' can be registered, but that was enough.<br>
In the first place, he only needed one character.<br>
"I will activate bookmark 1, ' Gongildu'."<br>
[Bookmark 1 has been activated.]<br>
[The activation time is determined in proportion to the level of the bookmark skill.]<br>
[Your understanding of the character is very high.]<br>
[The activation time of the bookmark skill is partially adjusted according to your exclusive characteristics.]<br>
[Activation time: 20 minutes]<br>
The character that had been protecting him was now inside him.<br>
[Activate exclusive skill 'Private Land Lv.10'!]<br>
Gong Pildu's private land occupied the area in an instant.<br>
However, this alone was not enough to activate the 'Armed Fortress'. This was because Gong Pildu's 'Armed Fortress' was not an exclusive skill, but a 'stigma'.<br>
[Bookmark] cannot borrow the 'stigma' of the person in question.<br>
Of course, Ye Hyunwoo had a countermeasure for that.<br>
"I will fulfill the contract with the Defense Master."<br>
[The constellation 'Defense Master' activates the contract.]<br>
A contract made with the 'Defense Master' in preparation for an emergency.<br>
The contract was simple.<br>
In exchange for granting the Defense Master's request, he would receive one of Gong Pildu's 'Stigmata' at a 'desired moment'.<br>
[You have acquired the temporary use of 'Armed Fortress'.]<br>
[The corresponding stigma will be converted to an 'Exclusive Skill' for the corresponding scenario.]<br>
[Exclusive Skill 'Armed Fortress Lv. 8' has been activated!]<br>
The ground beneath his feet rose and Ye Hyunwoo's body rose into the air.<br>
The outer wall of the 'Armed Fortress' that would protect him from any attack was growing.<br>
[What, what is this—]<br>
A small castle that grew more than twenty meters in an instant.<br>
It looked rather crude compared to the 'Armed Fortress' of Tech Tree Stage 10 that he was aiming for, but this was enough for now.<br>
[The 'Moving Fortress' is activated.]<br>
The fortress began to move along with the wheels that grew under the fortress.<br>
[The 'Turret' of the Armed Fortress is activated.]<br>
As the magnificent magic turrets aimed forward at once, the constellations that felt a sense of crisis shouted.<br>
[Didn't you say that guy can't do anything alone?]<br>
[Damn it, finish him off quickly! If that guy steals the effective hit—]<br>
Ye Hyunwoo sat on the castle's control tower while listening to the constellations' screams.<br>
[Activate the power of the item 'Shin Gijeon'.]<br>
[The 'turret's' arc destructive power increases!]<br>
[The 'turret's' shells have a tracking function added.]<br>
The castle's radar activated and the dusty 'Demon King of Salvation' appeared in the field of view.<br>
[Set the target of the strike.]<br>
The 'Demon King of Salvation' had already suffered massive damage to its incarnation body.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo, who had finally made up his mind, pressed the fire button.<br>
The 64 turrets opened fire, and a loud noise rang out as if they were sweeping away the forest. The dust rose pitch black.<br>
However, the scream heard within was not that of the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
[Kuaaaaaaaah!]<br>
The incarnations of the constellations burst into pieces in the dust.<br>
[The constellation 'monkey that fell from the tree' takes a huge blow and exits the scenario.]<br>
[The constellation 'rabbit without a liver' takes a huge blow and exits the scenario.]<br>
…<br>
Even some of the constellations could not withstand the blow and exited the scenario.<br>
Even so, Ye Hyunwoo did not stop.<br>
[You, why—]<br>
The indignant constellations aimed their weapons at him.<br>
Looking at the constellations running towards him, Ye Hyunwoo thought.<br>
「Why did I do that?」<br>
It was an unwise choice. Naturally, joining forces with those constellations to end the demon and share the story would have been the safe choice.<br>
However, the moment he saw the 'Demon King of Salvation' caught on the radar, Ye Hyunwoo could not make a safe choice.<br>
「It definitely wasn't the Demon King of Salvation that he .」<br>
The face of the 'Demon King of Salvation' who had become a demon was as pale as a corpse.<br>
A body like rags made of flesh. Eyes that had lost their light and skin that felt lifeless.<br>
In the end, this scenario had to end by hunting him.<br>
That's the only way to save the party.<br>
He came here before anyone else for that goal.<br>
Even so, the moment he saw Kim Dokja's face, Ye Hyunwoo felt faintly dizzy.<br>
「I don't know if the author will see it. But I'll try it anyway. There's a spell I sometimes recite when I'm having a hard time.」<br>
The enraged constellations abandoned the demon and began to run toward the castle.<br>
「I am Kim Dokja.」<br>
Ye Hyunwoo knew it too. He is not Kim Dokja. He knew better than anyone that he was not Kim Dokja, so he recited that spell.<br>
「But according to my friend, I resemble an octopus more than a squid.」<br>
Ye Hyunwoo pressed the fire button again and again.<br>
Piles of dirt scattered everywhere. The constellations screamed in frustration amidst the broken pieces of wood.<br>
[Kwaaaaah! Damn it!]<br>
[Hold on! Wait until the bastard’s magic runs out! How long can he keep up this barrage—]<br>
With the effect of [Magic Charge], magic power filled Ye Hyunwoo’s entire body once again.<br>
The core of the Invincible Castle’s tech tree—the 「Infinite Uroboros」system—was manifested.<br>
[Eww!]<br>
The constellations that had been holding on firmly began to fall one by one.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo’s inner self also gradually grew more certain.<br>
They were at most the incarnation bodies of 'great-grade constellations'. Even if the synchronization rate was increased in this 'Recycling Center' with limited rank, they would not be able to withstand the fortress' concentrated bombardment.<br>
[Warning! The durability of the 'Armed Fortress' is decreasing!]<br>
A thud was heard, along with the sound of something collapsing.<br>
Startled, Ye Hyunwoo checked the radar. However, nothing was detected. Someone was attacking the fortress at a speed that could not be detected by the detection system.<br>
Kugugugu.<br>
The current 'Armed Fortress' was now only a level 5 fortress.<br>
As powerful strikes continued, the outer wall of the fortress collapsed and cracks began to form on the inner wall.<br>
The moment Ye Hyunwoo, who had lost some energy, recharged his magic power once again and activated the turret, something appeared, breaking through the control tower's defense wall.<br>
[I didn't know that 'Armed Fortress' would be used like this. It's quite something.]<br>
Three incarnations appeared. They were all guys he had never seen before.<br>
The incarnation body of the constellation at the forefront approached Ye Hyunwoo like a ghost and grabbed him by the neck.<br>
[Why did you interfere with us?]<br>
Ye Hyunwoo laughed, hanging in the air.<br>
Even now, Ye Hyunwoo does not understand Kim Dokja, who sacrificed himself for the group.<br>
However, even though he did not understand him, Ye Hyunwoo liked him.<br>
The constellation, who was quietly looking at Ye Hyunwoo hanging in the air, spoke.<br>
[What you did just now wasn't courage, it was just foolishness.]<br>
The moment he heard that voice, Ye Hyunwoo felt goosebumps running down his spine.<br>
He realized something new.<br>
The 'Invincible Castle Tech Tree Stage 8' was designed to withstand attacks from 'great-grade constellations' inside the 'Recycling Center'.<br>
But if they had broken through this wall and entered, it was clear what kind of enemy they were.<br>
'Narrative-grade constellation'.<br>
The ominous sparks that surged through the air proved it.<br>
He couldn't understand it. How did a narrative-grade constellation intervene in the scenario of this 'Recycling Center'?<br>
[The worldview is unstable due to the aftermath of excessive probability.]<br>
[Many constellations are watching the 'Recycling Center'.]<br>
He could feel the gaze of the stars watching this place from the vast distance of space.<br>
How many constellations are watching this place?<br>
[The worldview rules of the 'Recycling Center' are weakened.]<br>
[The probability of the <Star Stream> starts to move!]<br>
[An unidentified nebula interferes with the probability of the 'Recycling Center'.]<br>
Olympus? Asgard? Veda?<br>
Or a small nebula that was hidden?<br>
The moment he saw the aftershock of probability that brightly colored the empty space, Ye Hyunwoo intuitively felt that this scenario had completely left his hands.<br>
[You also have a fragment of the oldest dream.]<br>
"Bam-"<br>
[This is really strange. Why do all the incarnations with this fragment invite death…]<br>
Feeling a hand tightly squeezing his neck, Ye Hyunwoo intuitively sensed his end.<br>
「"Kim Dokja, I will be ."」<br>
Considering his boastful words, he felt that it was a vain end. At the same time, he also thought that this was a very fitting end for him. Perhaps, ever since he first saw Cheon Inho in Chungmuro, he had a feeling this day would come.<br>
He couldn’t become Kim Dokja.<br>
There was someone in this world who was much more suited to Kim Dokja’s place.<br>
His role was to play the role of an extra in the lines that no one would remember.<br>
However, if there was one last regret, it was this.<br>
「I really wanted to say thank you. I’ll come back to see you again in a few days.」<br>
That he couldn’t keep the promise he left in that comment.<br>
As the powerful magic flowed through the constellation’s hand, his consciousness began to fade.<br>
If he died like this and became a fragment of Kim Dokja, would he be able to meet Jiyoon again? Would he be able to laugh and talk about this story when they met again?<br>
Look, if you really possess someone in 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint', you'll die right away. Saying that—<br>
Would he be able to not regret reading this story?<br>
Ye Hyunwoo waited for death with such thoughts.<br>
However, no matter how much time passed, his consciousness did not disappear. He felt his body floating in the air, and someone was holding him and putting him down on the floor.<br>
He slowly opened his eyes and raised his head, and saw someone's back.<br>
[The <Star Stream> intervenes in the probability aftermath of the area.]<br>
[The probability scale moves.]<br>
Is it Kim Dokja?<br>
But when he looked again, he was wearing a black cloak.<br>
So is it Yoo Jonghyuk?<br>
No. He was smaller than Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
Ye Hyunwoo noticed the words written on his back.<br>
『OLD SCHOOL』.<br>
Old School.<br>
The boy wearing the cloak looked back at him. The moment he met those eyes that felt strangely stubborn, Ye Hyunwoo thought he knew who he was.<br>
That's because he had read this story fifty times.<br>
"You... look like my ."<br>
A being who could move the 'probability scale' against those scary constellations.<br>
"Thank you for saving my hyung."<br>
<Kim Dokja Company> came to the 'Recycling Center'.

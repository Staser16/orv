796 Episode 38 Chance (2)<br>
The back of Jaehwan, who was walking a few steps ahead, was blurry.<br>
Walking, stopping for a moment to rest, and walking again.<br>
I repeated that simple task while carrying Yoo Jonghyuk who had fallen.<br>
[Your incarnation body is unstable.]<br>
[Warning. Enter a new 'scenario'.]<br>
It wasn't some kind of health alert, and I smiled bitterly as I heard the same message intermittently.<br>
Who wouldn't enter the 'main scenario' without knowing?<br>
「I wonder if it was a mistake to intentionally fail the 'scenario'?」<br>
An old sentiment came flooding back, but I didn't really regret it.<br>
At that time, it was the best choice.<br>
Failing the scenario and being stripped of the status of 'constellation'. And thus being banished outside the scenarios.<br>
That was the only way to save all the readers, including the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
[Your incarnation body is unstable.]<br>
The cough that I spit out left a trail of stories.<br>
[Your incarnation body is breaking apart.]<br>
A body that would not be strange if it collapsed at any moment. Nevertheless, my incarnation body still managed to maintain its shape.<br>
[Exclusive trait effect is activated.]<br>
[The effect of the exclusive trait 'Record Repairer' delays the collapse of your incarnation body.]<br>
Exclusive trait 'Record Repairer'.<br>
This trait, which was activated by collecting a certain amount of 'Kim Dokja Fragments', had a certain level of immunity effect only against the collapse of the incarnation body.<br>
Of course, this trait alone was not enough to withstand the collapse.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activating.]<br>
The [Fourth Wall]. Kim Dokja's main skill, and the skill that saved him from danger every time, if this skill hadn't been activated in time, I would have passed out without being able to overcome the pain.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated.]<br>
I imagined the 'Demon King of Salvation' and the little Kim Dokja beyond this wall.<br>
People who still liked this story even after going through that terrible scenario together.<br>
「Kim Dokja thought.」<br>
They were talking.<br>
「We have to survive.」<br>
With a thud, the story flowed back once more.<br>
How many more times did I vomit stories like that?<br>
Jaehwan, who had been walking far away, stopped walking. It seemed like he was going to take a short break.<br>
I laid Yoo Jonghyuk down on a stone floating around.<br>
Is it the effect of the 'Summoning Squad' I had fed him earlier? Yoo Jonghyuk's incarnation was quickly recovering.<br>
The deep wound below his kneecap was also slowly healing.<br>
After all, the main character is the main character.<br>
If this continues, Yoo Jonghyuk will be able to finish recovering and return to the scenario in a few days.<br>
The problem is that I don't know if I will be alive by then.<br>
[Your incarnation body is unstable.]<br>
I felt drowsy once in a while, and every time I did, a terrible cold air came over me.<br>
I must not lose consciousness.<br>
I desperately recalled Kim Dokja’s story.<br>
Sometimes, Kim Dokja had experienced something similar to me.<br>
「If I don’t quickly save my incarnation body and seal my wounds, all my stories will collapse and I will die.」<br>
I imagined Kim Dokja walking alone on the horizon of the stories. Kim Dokja walking alone in the world without a star’s gaze or a scenario.<br>
He ate the story fragments on the horizon of the stories, and used them to repair his incarnation body and overcome the crisis.<br>
How did 'Kim Dokja' absorb the story fragments back then?<br>
「Lamarck’s giraffe.」<br>
That’s right. Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation', clearly had such a trait. If that’s the case, then I can also use that trait.<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' looks at you with displeasure.]<br>
[The story 'Heir of the Eternal Name' grumbles and begins its storytelling.]<br>
After a while, a light bulb turned on in my head, and the trait was activated.<br>
[You can now temporarily use the exclusive attribute 'Lamarck's Giraffe'.]<br>
Lamarck's Giraffe.<br>
With this trait, Kim Dokja was able to temporarily restore his incarnation body by absorbing small 'story fragments'.<br>
The problem is that I don't have any remaining 'story fragments' to use for restoration.<br>
That's when the sound of a vacuum cleaner could be heard from afar.<br>
A flock of 'nameless things' swimming through space. Behind the guys who were scurrying around the void like a school of mackerel, a monster with a fierce appetite could be seen. An eerie presence that could be clearly felt from afar.<br>
A deity from another world. The shark-headed alien with a human body was disturbing the group like a predator, biting the 'nameless ones'.<br>
I really hoped it wouldn't look this way, but this time, the <Star Stream> betrayed my expectations.<br>
【Ooooooooo】<br>
The alien's cries made my mind dizzy. The guy who quickly wiggled his fins rushed towards me with his fearsome teeth flashing.<br>
A murderous feeling that made my spine tingle.<br>
The moment I instinctively grabbed the hilt of 'Unbreakable Faith' sword, a flash of light flashed before my eyes.<br>
Jaehwan swung his sword.<br>
The shark alien that had opened its mouth wide disappeared with its head exploding.<br>
It was an unbelievable act of inaction. Even if it wasn't at the level of the 'Dream Eater', it seemed like an outer deity with its own name.<br>
In any case, now was not the time to be completely surprised. This was because the fragments of the outer deity's legend floating in the void caught my eye.<br>
[Exclusive trait 'Lamarck's Giraffe' reacts.]<br>
Most of them were contaminated or damaged and unusable, but there were some that I could consume now.<br>
I sneakily looked at Jaehwan's expression and asked.<br>
"Can I eat that?"<br>
Jaehwan glanced at me indifferently and quickly turned his head away.<br>
I quickly approached the Shark's story fragment. I saw a story fragment that looked exactly like a shark's fin.<br>
[Story fragment 'Rapid Swim' rejects your touch.]<br>
[The story in question is contaminated.]<br>
[Eating the story in question may cause side effects.]<br>
Judging from the strong fishy smell, it seemed like it would be difficult to eat it as it was even if I utilized 'Lamarck's Giraffe'.<br>
After thinking for a moment, I searched through the arms of the unconscious Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
Let's see, if my thoughts are right, he should have 'that item'. After a while, something like a small seasoning container was caught in my fingertips.<br>
I checked the item information.<br>
+<br>
<Item Information><br>
Name: All-purpose special seasoning<br>
Grade: A+<br>
Description: Essence made from natural ingredients of the <Star Stream>. When sprayed, anything becomes edible. The recipe has not been revealed.<br>
+<br>
As expected, Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
I didn't have high expectations, but I didn't know this item really existed.<br>
「All-purpose special seasoning. It's an item developed by Yoo Jonghyuk in the second round for emergency cooking. He himself doesn't use it often.」<br>
Why do people carry around things like this and not use them? I don't know.<br>
I roughly sprinkled the special seasoning on the still fluttering fins, then took a deep breath and swallowed it.<br>
The snow shard tasted like ramen soup sprinkled on the shark fin.<br>
[Exclusive trait 'amak's effect activates!]<br>
[Story fragment 'Swimming Speed' refuses to<br>
The story fragment that entered my stomach began to shake. My stomach rumbled as if I had an emergency. However, I couldn't just spit it out.<br>
[Your incarnation body is in danger.]<br>
If I spit this out now, I'll die. So I have to swallow it. I have to grit my teeth and get through it somehow.<br>
That's when someone hit my back with a thud. It hurt so much I screamed, so I turned around and saw Jaehwan there.<br>
Why are you suddenly hitting someone? Are you a psychopath?<br>
Jaehwan looked at me for a moment without answering, then walked over and sat down nearby, sitting cross-legged.<br>
Only then did I realize why he had hit my back.<br>
[Your digestive ability is enhanced.]<br>
[Exclusive trait 'Lamarck's Giraffe' is strongly activated.]<br>
[Story fragment 'Rapid Swim' has been absorbed.]<br>
Could it be that he's helping me now? Not someone else, but 'Monarch Slayer' Jaehwan?<br>
[Your incarnation body temporarily regains stability.]<br>
I felt my hunger disappearing quickly and my incarnation body recovering. I thought I could easily last another day or two at this rate.<br>
"I, thank you."<br>
I bowed my head toward Jaehwan. Jaehwan pretended not to hear me and closed his eyes.<br>
Is he repeating his mental stabbing toward the universe again?<br>
What on earth is he trying to stab with all that effort?<br>
I looked at Jaehwan for a moment and then muttered while examining Yoo Jonghyuk's details again.<br>
"You say thank you too."<br>
Of course, Yoo Jonghyuk, who had passed out, didn't answer. It had been a while since I'd seen him sleeping so soundly. Even now, it seems like it was just yesterday that I was thrown under the bridge at Oksu Station, but I realized that a lot has happened since then.<br>
While going back and forth between the Washington Dome and the Recycling Center, Yoo Jonghyuk became a black beast, and also a little Yoo Jonghyuk wearing a red hat. He almost died several times, and in the end, this is what happened.<br>
Damn bastard. Why did you chase me all the way here? This didn't happen even in the third round.<br>
If he hadn't come to save me, Yoo Jonghyuk would have cleared the 'Recycling Center' without a hitch and started growing. His transcendence would have been higher, and he would have moved on to the next scenario without a hitch with the readers of Earth.<br>
I ruined everything.<br>
So I have to save this guy.<br>
After feeding Yoo Jonghyuk the 'summoning group' that I had divided up, I took a breather for a moment.<br>
While he was eating the remaining summoning group crumbs, my eyes met with Jaehwan's, who was looking at me.<br>
Why is he looking? I feel uneasy.<br>
I recalled the information about him in my head.<br>
「The Monarch Slayer Jaehwan.」<br>
Fortunately, since 『The World After The Fall』 was a work I was involved in, I remembered quite a bit of information about him.<br>
For example, if someone asked me, "Who is Jaehwan?", I could answer like this.<br>
「The protagonist who destroys the world by stabbing while naked.」<br>
After summarizing, he seems like the type of person you should never get entangled with.<br>
I thought for a moment and held out the summoning crumbs to Jaehwan.<br>
"Would you like some?"<br>
When you first become close, isn't it best to share food?<br>
Whether he was naked or destroyed the world by stabbing, it was something that happened in his universe.<br>
And in this <Star Stream>, he saved me twice.<br>
Who knows? Maybe that 'Monarch Slayer' became a little kinder under the influence of the <Star Stream> worldview.<br>
"You eat it."<br>
I felt a familiar comfort in his sharp answer and asked back.<br>
"What do you usually eat?"<br>
"I don't eat anything in particular."<br>
"If you don't eat anything, you die."<br>
Jaehwan didn't answer and just stared at me. Thanks to someone, I was already used to that kind of gaze.<br>
I shook the seasoning bottle and smiled.<br>
"If there's anything you want, I'll make it for you. There's some good seasoning here."<br>
I didn't really plan on cooking. I'm not Yoo Jonghyuk from the 81st round of 'Ways of Survival', so what kind of food would I cook in this 'change of scenario'? Even if I made it, it would be nothing more than 'Foreign Correspondent Sharkspin who died from a brutal stabbing'.<br>
But I wanted to talk to that man who was hard to get close to, even like this.<br>
life and Yoo Jonghyuk's life depended on that good-natured psychopath for the next week.<br>
If he changed his mind and stabbed us to death right now, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' would end here.<br>
"The kind of food I want to eat?"<br>
Huh?<br>
"No one can make it now."<br>
I was a little taken aback by his answer. I never imagined that the 'Monarch Slayer' would have a food he wanted to eat.<br>
"What kind of food is it?"<br>
If possible, I was going to refer to 'Yoo Jonghyuk from the 81st round's recipe and make it. If I didn't have the ingredients, I could just raid Yoo Jonghyuk's coat pockets.<br>
Jaehwan stared into space for a moment as if recalling a distant memory, then opened his mouth.<br>
"Dumplings."<br>
I looked at him for a moment, wondering if I had heard wrong.<br>
What did you say just now?<br>
"It's a food called 'Murim Dumplings'."

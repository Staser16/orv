800 Episode 38 Chance (6)<br>
A splendid army of seraphs illuminated the darkness. The seraphs of <Eden>, each of which was as strong as a great-grade constellation, and the archangels of <Eden> who commanded them, revealed their outlines in the void.<br>
As expected, most of them were archangels I knew.<br>
[The constellation 'Lily Aquarius' looks at you.]<br>
Archangel Gabriel.<br>
[The constellation 'Guardian of Youth and Travel' looks at you.]<br>
Archangel Raphael.<br>
[The constellation 'Friend of Justice and Harmony' takes pity on you.]<br>
[The constellation 'He who looks face to face with God' looks at you.]<br>
Archangel Raguel and Camael.<br>
[The constellation 'Commander of the Red Cosmos' is looking at you.]<br>
Killer King's sponsor, Archangel Jophiel.<br>
[The constellation 'Savior of the Fall' is looking at you.]<br>
Even Michael, the strongest archangel.<br>
I calmed my pounding heart and checked the faces of the archangels again and again.<br>
Uriel is gone.<br>
A belated worry came over me.<br>
Maybe she had tried too hard to save me last time. Or maybe I had received some kind of threat from <Eden>.<br>
「Come to your senses.」<br>
As if it was not the time to worry about Uriel, the Demon King of Salvation warned through the [Fourth Wall]. I swallowed and nodded.<br>
The fact that I could endure facing such magnificent archangels was all thanks to the naked (clothed) man blocking my way.<br>
The monarch slayer Jaehwan.<br>
I realized once again how great he was. Even if you search through the entire <Star Stream>, it would be difficult to find a constellation that wouldn’t be intimidated by a single giant nebula.<br>
Even that figure calmly reaching for the hilt of his sword as if such a threat was ridiculous…<br>
"Wait a minute!"<br>
"What is it?"<br>
Jaehwan glared at me with a sharp gaze. I belatedly regretted it.<br>
Now that I think about it, why did I do that?<br>
Why did I stop Jaehwan?<br>
"They might not have come to fight."<br>
That’s right. That was my reason.<br>
While I was with the 'Demon King of Salvation', I was chased by giant nebulas several times.<br>
<Asgard> and <Olympus>. Or small nebulas like <Gwiok>.<br>
But I’ve never been chased by <Eden>.<br>
"Let’s talk about it first."<br>
"Why should I?"<br>
By the way, Jaehwan, the 'Monarch Slayer', has another nickname, 'God Slayer'.<br>
"There's no need to hurt someone who doesn't have any hostility."<br>
"That guy Yoo Jonghyuk told me. He said that there are no harmless constellations in the world."<br>
Jonghyuk, what on earth did he say?<br>
"No, constellations aren’t generally harmful."<br>
I don't know why I'm defending the constellations.<br>
But this was the only way to prevent a catastrophe. If there was Uriel among them that I hadn't discovered, it would be a big deal.<br>
I took a deep breath and spoke in one breath.<br>
"That's Yoo Jonghyuk's standard, and yours is different. Look at those fluttering pure white wings. Do they look like bad constellations to you?"<br>
Jaehwan glanced at the archangels again at my words. Maybe the monarch killer was a pretty sensible person.<br>
At that moment, one of the archangels who caught my eye stepped forward. He was the archangel who shouldn't have stepped forward the most.<br>
[You are the 'Monarch Slayer'—]<br>
I stepped in front of Jaehwan before Archangel Stab was activated.<br>
"Over there! Wait a minute! Over there!"<br>
[...?]<br>
"Savior of the ! Don't finish that sentence now!"<br>
Michael glared at me as I stepped in front of Jaehwan and opened my mouth again.<br>
[What are you?]<br>
Michael, the Savior of the Fall, is a constellation of the Tale of the Fall. He's not even a simple Tale of the Fall, he's an archangel who can reach the level of a myth-grade when he activates 'Demon King'. There's probably only one incarnation in the entire <Star Stream> who can tease an archangel like that.<br>
"Me? I'm Kim Dokja."<br>
Damn it, why am I Kim Dokja?<br>
Michael, who had been glaring at me, asked back in a stupid voice.<br>
[So?]<br>
"Let's all get along well."<br>
An eerie silence swept over the surroundings. I heard Raphael's sighing voice, and I also saw Gabriel shaking his head with his hand on his head. Jophiel stared at me as if he was looking at a strange creature.<br>
And then,<br>
Kugugugugu!<br>
Michael began to unleash his power without hesitation.<br>
[The constellation 'Savior of the Fall' reveals his power.]<br>
I hid behind Jaehwan again while watching Michael approaching step by step.<br>
Honestly, why wouldn't I want to see it?<br>
Michael vs. Jaehwan.<br>
Savior of the Fall vs. Monarch Slayer.<br>
Especially, if it was Michael and Jaehwan who activated 'Demon King', it would be a spectacle that I wouldn't be able to see even if I paid a thousand gold coins.<br>
However, that's something rlaehrwk41 would think about, and it wasn't something I would be thinking about right now.<br>
If a great clash of myth-grade constellations occurred right before my eyes, Yoo Jonghyuk and I would be swept away by the fierce waves of the stories and our limbs would be torn apart.<br>
"Hey, Jaehwan-ssi. Actually, this is a bad guy. Could you kill just one of them?"<br>
While Jaehwan was looking back at me as if he was dumbfounded, the other archangels were approaching Michael.<br>
I shouted in a hurry.<br>
"Wait a minute! Stop! You know how scary this guy is!"<br>
Thankfully, the archangels had heard rumors of Jaehwan and were not acting rashly.<br>
I quickly added.<br>
"And this guy is not an evil person! He rejects evil and worships good! Isn't that the motto of your <Eden>? Never judge by appearances! He's even dressed so neatly!"<br>
"You bastard."<br>
I ignored Jaehwan's growling words and continued to shout.<br>
"This person saved me and Yoo Jonghyuk. He saved us from the terrible constellations of <Olympus> and <Asgard>— from the gods of the other world!"<br>
Jaehwan's sword, which was half-drawn, stopped for the first time. It felt like he was trying to hear what I was saying.<br>
"This person also patted my back when I swallowed story fragments. It hurt so much that I could die, but I survived, so I guess I received the grace of life."<br>
"..."<br>
"Is that all? He stabbed and killed every outer god who came near him for a whole ten days. Where else would you find someone who would show me such kindness while the giant nebulae were after me? Yes?"<br>
When I came to my senses, I found myself repeating the argument of the 'Demon King of Salvation' like a parrot. But as I spoke, it seemed like he was right.<br>
A murderer of monarchs is not a villain. At least to me and Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
However, Archangel Jophiel seemed to have a slightly different opinion.<br>
[He is evil.]<br>
An ominous light was flowing out of Jophiel’s eyes. His stigma, [Eye of Sin], had been activated.<br>
When Jaehwan glared at him as if asking what was that, the light of [Eye of Sin] went out with a tsk-tsk sound. It seemed that an absolute being from another universe could extinguish a stigma just by glaring at it.<br>
But even in that situation, Jophiel seemed to have witnessed something.<br>
I struck first before he could open his mouth.<br>
"Yes. Of course, it could be different depending on the perspective—"<br>
[He slaughtered over a million gods.]<br>
I looked back at Jaehwan.<br>
This kid is a villain, right?<br>
But I pretended to be calm and responded.<br>
"Couldn’t all the gods he killed be bad guys? He must have done it with good intentions. Right? He must have tried to make the world a better place—"<br>
"My goal was to destroy the world."<br>
"Yes, so to put it simply, in order to kill the evil gods and purify the world—"<br>
"I killed them because they got in my way."<br>
I wanted to tell him to shut up, but since ancient times, protagonists have never shut up when told to.<br>
In the meantime, another protagonist who had come to his senses spoke to me.<br>
—Kim Dokja.<br>
Little Yoo Jonghyuk was getting up from the floating stone. He seemed to have figured out the general situation.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk opened his mouth to the archangels, receiving my gaze that told him to stop them somehow.<br>
"I want to kill them all."<br>
Jaehwan nodded and muttered at Yoo Jonghyuk's words.<br>
"There are times when we can see eye to eye."<br>
The situation was becoming increasingly chaotic.<br>
The moment I thought that this wouldn't be easy to solve even if the Demon King of Salvation came in person, Jaehwan's expression changed for the first time.<br>
"This is fun."<br>
The word 'fun' sounded different after meeting him.<br>
I followed Jaehwan's gaze, hiding my ominous feelings. Then, the line of seraphs split, and an archangel was seen walking from the back.<br>
The mythical constellation of <Eden> was there.<br>
The controller of the archangels, and the second-in-command of <Eden>.<br>
[The constellation 'Heavenly Scribe' is looking at you.]<br>
Heavenly Scribe, Metatron.<br>
Who would have thought I would see him here?<br>
I bit my lips without realizing it. The fact that he was  in person meant that <Eden> was serious about this situation.<br>
[It's nice to meet you.]<br>
A uniquely polite and calm voice.<br>
The first place his eyes turned to was little Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
[The oldest dream’s puppet.]<br>
Then he looked at Jaehwan.<br>
[The monarch slayer.]<br>
Finally, he stared at me.<br>
[And...]<br>
He looked at me for a long time, then continued speaking with a faint sense of pride.<br>
[Little lamb. You're afraid.]<br>
Of course. My sponsor would be scared if legions of archangels came rushing in. What's more, if the opponent was 'Metatron', the master of strategy that even Kim Dokja would shiver with…<br>
[Don't worry. <Eden> and I will not harm you. We have no intention of changing the contents of the 'Revelation'.]<br>
I immediately revised my evaluation of Metatron in my head.<br>
What kind of place is <Eden>? It is a nebula of angels. Angels are generally kind. If he is the representative of such angels, then he must be the kindest angel of all.<br>
I briefly hoped that he might mediate all of this.<br>
[However, I cannot tolerate beings who break the balance of this world line.]<br>
It was a vain hope.<br>
The moment Metatron and Jaehwan's gazes crossed, Jaehwan pulled out his sword with a bitter smile.<br>
"Your tongue is long. If you are going to attack, attack quickly."<br>
The archangels who were guarding Metatron quietly raised their voices at his arrogant tone.<br>
Nevertheless, Jaehwan continued to speak as if provoking them.<br>
“Do you think you can stop me with just a single person?”<br>
The strength to fight a giant nebula alone.<br>
Metatron acknowledged Jaehwan like that.<br>
He nodded.<br>
[Absolute being of another world line. I know you are strong. If we were to eliminate you, we would not be safe either.]<br>
"You will all die here."<br>
Metatron shrugged lightly and smiled bitterly.<br>
[I guess you forgot that this is not your 'worldview'.]<br>
That was when I felt an unusual magical power behind us. A being with the exact opposite attribute of the archangels.<br>
There were beings that should not be there.<br>
[The Demon King 'Lord of Hell' descends into the void!]<br>
[The Demon King 'Sonic Demon King' descends into the void!]<br>
[The Demon King 'Temptation and Barren Demon King' descends into the void!]<br>
[The Demon King 'Merciless Hunter of the Reverse Heaven' descends into the void!]<br>
…<br>
[The Demon King 'Ruler of Eastern Hell' descends into the void!]<br>
Demon Kings. It was unbelievable.<br>
Why on earth did they show up here?<br>
They wouldn't be trying to start a holy war here.<br>
Hold on. Holy war?<br>
"Run away. Right now."<br>
Jaehwan glared at me as if I was talking nonsense.<br>
"Are you talking about me just now?"<br>
"That's right! Run away with me and Yoo Jonghyuk! Right now!"<br>
I don't think Jaehwan will lose. Even if it's a myth-grade constellation, even if it's the famous <Eden>, it wouldn't be easy to deal with Jaehwan.<br>
「But if it's 'sealing' him, it might be a different story.」<br>
Two pitch-black swirling spheres were placed in Metatron's hands. I already knew what those spheres were.<br>
[Get out of this story. Ghost of a ruined universe.]<br>
That was a forbidden technique that Han Sooyoung once used to seal 'Yoo Jonghyuk of the 1,863rd round.'<br>
[Mythical tale 'Seal of the Apocalypse' begins its storytelling!]<br>
As long as this is the <Star Stream>, there is no one who can break that seal.

804 Episode 39 Rumor (3)<br>
We were locked up in Namgung Sega's Brain Jade.<br>
To be honest, I wondered if it made sense to lock us up for badmouthing their own dumplings, but the group called Odae Sega was no ordinary group.<br>
As soon as we entered Brain Jade, the first thing that greeted us were the existing prisoners.<br>
"Hahaha, it looks like another newcomer has come in."<br>
From the big bosses of the Gumurim generation to the criminals of the Shinmurim. The prisoners who found Yoo Jonghyuk were glued to the bars and licking their lips.<br>
"What a soft little brat."<br>
"You were unlucky, brat. Your life is obvious now that you've come this far."<br>
"What a chubby little brat, should I boil it or roast it—"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk looked at the prisoners with indifferent eyes and then picked out the two men who seemed to be the best among them.<br>
"In-soo Electrode. Na-tae-geom Lee Cheol-gun."<br>
The men who had been called by nicknames by Yoo Jonghyuk opened their eyes wide and muttered.<br>
"Huh, how did our nicknames…?"<br>
"You will die in the 'Terror Expedition' in 28 days."<br>
A sudden silence spread through the prison at Yoo Jonghyuk's death curse.<br>
A middle-aged man who had been locked up in the opposite prison woke up belatedly.<br>
"You bratty brat, you've really lost your mind!"<br>
"Baeksalgeom Mahyung."<br>
Baeksalgeom Mahyung, whose name had been called, glared at Yoo Jonghyuk with his eyes wide open.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk looked at him for a moment and then declared.<br>
"You will die now."<br>
"What? Keuhahaha—"<br>
Baeksalgeom Mahyung laughed for a long time, saying "Keuhahahaha," as if he had heard a lame joke. And after a while, Mahyung grabbed his heart, knelt down, vomited blood, and died.<br>
"Wh, what's going on! What the heck!"<br>
"Mahyung?"<br>
"What happened? Are you kidding me?"<br>
"Guard, where is the guard!"<br>
A while later, a guard who had been hurriedly dispatched confirmed the death of Baeksalgeom Mahyung. It was a heart attack of unknown cause.<br>
"If there's anyone else who wants to know their lifespan, come out."<br>
With that, the prisoners' mockery disappeared.<br>
I asked inwardly, amazed.<br>
—How did you do it? Did you kill him with a skill?<br>
—I just saw a guy who was about to die. That's all.<br>
The 41st round’s regressor. He's scary.<br>
Of course, not everyone thought Yoo Jonghyuk was scary.<br>
"Are you really the disciple of Breaking the Sky Sword Saint? You're so amazing."<br>
The guards seemed to find Yoo Jonghyuk's talent amazing and did not spare their praise.<br>
"Did you really foresee Mahyung's death? I heard that even Breaking the Sky Sword Saint had the power of foresight..."<br>
"By the way, he really is a handsome kid."<br>
Looking at the guards who couldn't stop admiring Yoo Jonghyuk's appearance, I remembered reading a study that said that 'good-looking prisoners' were more likely to receive a lighter sentence in the courtroom.<br>
"Just hold on here for a bit. Food will be served on time. The food in our brain prison is better than you think."<br>
"..."<br>
"Don't worry too much. If you just apologize well, the lord will soon release you. Namgung Sega isn't that vulgar."<br>
Isn't this guy Yoo Jonghyuk just living his life in easy mode because he's handsome?<br>
Well, anyway.<br>
—Alright. Since we've come this far, we should be safe today.<br>
Just in case, I tried using the story fragment 「A Bird Listening to Daytime Talk」 again, but I didn't detect any beings watching us like before.<br>
Namgung Sega has a few masters who have reached transcendence, and there are also incarnations that appear in higher scenarios.<br>
Even this brain prison is designed so that even the most high-ranking constellations can't easily enter and exit.<br>
As long as we're in the martial arts world, it's hard to find a safer place than this.<br>
I took advantage of the absence of guards to quietly release 'Thoughts'.<br>
—You're doing something dangerous.<br>
—There's no choice. There's a time limit for transformation.<br>
Although there were suddenly two prisoners in the cramped cell, I couldn't maintain 'Thoughts' forever.<br>
And I had a plan in case I got caught.<br>
[Item 'Deodorizing Spray' was used.]<br>
[Item 'Travel Bed' was used.]<br>
[Item 'Someone's Old Blanket' was used.]<br>
[Hidden item combination completed.]<br>
[Special option 'It's Dangerous Outside the Blanket' is activated.]<br>
It was a 'Honeymoon Item' combination that Kim Dokja had told me about some time ago.<br>
The completed blanket tent naturally blended into the background of the prison.<br>
I warned Yoo Jonghyuk, who was looking at me with a dumbfounded look.<br>
—Don't talk to me, I'm going to do something important from now on.<br>
I curled up in the blanket and immediately turned on Kim Dokja's sacred relic, the smartphone.<br>
「Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World.」<br>
[There is an unopened 'bookmark' in the file.]<br>
[Would you like to move to the bookmarked page?]<br>
As expected, there was a bookmark marked by the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
It must be a page with information necessary for the current situation.<br>
Flipping through the pages, I checked the tasks that were currently facing me.<br>
One, find a way to repair the incarnation body.<br>
If I don’t repair the incarnation body within three days, I will die.<br>
Two, enter the new main scenario.<br>
Even if I repair the incarnation body, if I don’t enter the 'main scenario' and escape my status as an exile, I will still die.<br>
Fortunately, I could somehow find a solution to these two tasks if I just met 'Breaking the Sky Sword Saint'.<br>
The problem was the third.<br>
Three, find 'the second Kim Dokja'.<br>
The Demon King of Salvation said.<br>
'The second Kim Dokja' is somewhere in this universe. However, for some reason, contact has been lost.<br>
Fortunately, the Demon King of Salvation knew the last location where 'the second Kim Dokja' was detected.<br>
The problem was that the 'entrances' to that location in this <Star Stream> were extremely limited.<br>
「Read the 999th round. You’ll probably be able to get help.」<br>
I slowly turned the page while checking the note left by the Demon King of Salvation.<br>
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and I couldn’t leave to meet the second Kim Dokja right away. For now, the best thing to do was to reread the given 'Ways of Survival' and check the roadmap.<br>
I calmly began reading 'Ways of Survival' sentence by sentence.<br>
I knew that the length of one 'Ways of Survival' was strangely long, but I was surprised once again.<br>
This kind of writing is not in the right mind of the writer or the reader.<br>
「The items that can be obtained in 'First Murim' are as follows.」<br>
Sentences that were so boring that even someone who was stuck on a deserted island and had nothing left to read would probably hesitate.<br>
「How to obtain the Book of Extermination’s Martial Arts…」<br>
Excessively extensive settings and detailed descriptions.<br>
「So the Transcendent Seats finally decide to elect the 'King of the Transcendent Seats'.」<br>
「The basic materials for producing the Dark Moon Theater are as follows.」<br>
As I read the dry sentences, I couldn't help but think about the person who pressed down on each and every word of those sentences.<br>
Han Sooyoung really wanted to save Kim Dokja.<br>
—Is that important?<br>
When I raised my head, little Yoo Jonghyuk, who had lifted the blanket, was looking down at me as if I was pitiful.<br>
—It is important.<br>
—What are you doing?<br>
I thought for a moment and decided to be honest.<br>
—I'm reading a novel.<br>
I thought there would definitely be sharp criticism, but unexpectedly Yoo Jonghyuk sighed quietly and sat down.<br>
—You should get some rest too. There aren't many times when we can rest comfortably like now.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk started his morning meal while being greeted by the moonlight seeping through the bars of the prison. I thought he was a bit weird because he said resting was like eating breakfast, but even that was typical of Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
In a situation where it wouldn’t be strange if he died tomorrow, one person ate breakfast and the other read a novel.<br>
「When does the captain rest?」<br>
It was the scene where Lee Hyunsung asked Yoo Jonghyuk in the 999th round.<br>
「When the old dream stops.」<br>
I thought while watching Yoo Jonghyuk who was constantly working hard.<br>
Will he, who was born as 'Yoo Jonghyuk', really be allowed to have a proper rest? Will his old dream finally end when he reaches the end of this forgotten world line?<br>
I don’t know.<br>
Maybe Kim Dokja or Han Sooyoung don’t know either.<br>
In a sense, the 41st round is just being written.<br>
What we can anticipate right now is not the distant future, but tomorrow.<br>
—That beating must hurt a lot.<br>
*<br>
The next day, Yoo Jonghyuk wasn’t beaten. He was even released from the prison.<br>
I had an ominous feeling. Could it be that the Emperor Sword Namgung Jincheon was trying to make Yoo Jonghyuk’s insults disappear?<br>
If that’s the case, then all the plans I’ve made so far will be in vain.<br>
More than anything, if Namgung Se goes out, our safety will not be guaranteed.<br>
"Treat him with utmost respect. He is an honored guest."<br>
While being guided by the servants, I had no idea how the situation was going.<br>
Did he go from being a prisoner  to a VIP overnight?<br>
—Did Breaking the Sky Sword Saint come visit?<br>
—I didn’t get that feeling.<br>
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint didn’t even come, but the way we were treated changed?<br>
This was a situation where anyone could see that there was an ulterior motive.<br>
—Your plan seems to have been successful.<br>
—I don’t know if I should call this a success.<br>
The VIP room of Namgung Se, where only the elders of the Gupaebang and the famous masters of Murim can stay.<br>
Foods prepared by trained masters were being arranged on the table in front of me. Every time I think of Murim, I only think of chicken soup, noodles, and Murim dumplings, but I was surprised that there were so many foods.<br>
Dongpa pork and Ojangyuk that melted in your mouth. And even Peking duck.<br>
Since I was a dwarf with 'thoughts', I couldn't eat all these foods to my heart's content, which was a shame.<br>
On the other hand, Yoo Jonghyuk was eating well.<br>
—But can you eat that?<br>
—What?<br>
—You don't eat food made by others.<br>
—What are you talking about?<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, who had stuffed his cheeks with food, glared at me with an expression that said, "What nonsense are you talking about?"<br>
Oh, you idiot.<br>
Did you forget that you couldn't eat 'food made by others'?<br>
—No, just eat a lot.<br>
I thought it was better. Also, in that situation, he would have had to eat dirt.<br>
The situation was a bit strange, but it wasn't easy to find a situation where he could eat his fill and rest comfortably.<br>
[The story fragment 'The Man Who Eats Eight Meals a Day' begins its storytelling.]<br>
The story fragment seemed to be intrigued as well, encouraging Yoo Jonghyuk to binge eat. While watching little Yoo Jonghyuk's stomach swell in real time, I also occasionally picked up some food to eat.<br>
A whole day passed while we enjoyed eight meals, including breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br>
Breaking the Sky Sword Saint did not come to find us.<br>
Instead, it was Jewanggeom Namgungjin who came to find us.<br>
"It feels good to see the boy eating well."<br>
Namgung Jincheon, who came with his characteristically good-natured smile, nodded his head in satisfaction as he looked at Yoo Jonghyuk's chubby cheeks.<br>
"It really hurt when the boy spat out our dumplings."<br>
"They were trash."<br>
"I admit it. It didn't bring out the true taste of Murim dumplings."<br>
Unexpectedly, Namgung Jincheon readily admitted it.<br>
Since ancient times, in Murim, you have to be careful when your opponent is humble. That means they clearly want something.<br>
"Is the boy really a disciple of 'Breaking the Sky Sword Saint'?"<br>
"If so?"<br>
"Can you prove it?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk rolled up his chopsticks as I had mentioned before and slowly recreated the first move of [Breaking the Sky Sword Saint].<br>
Was it because it was a first move swung by a kid with no magical power and a chubby belly? It looked like a swordsmanship that wouldn't even break a rice bowl, let alone the sky. Wait a minute.<br>
Did this human forget [Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship]?<br>
"Don't reveal that martial arts to the outside world. It'll definitely cause a fuss."<br>
Namgung Jincheon nodded, but I couldn't read his thoughts at all.<br>
Are you really going to believe that?<br>
Do you have no eyes for martial arts?<br>
"This is the first time a disciple of Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship has come to Namgung Sega."<br>
Jewanggeom looked at Yoo Jonghyuk with a serious look and continued.<br>
"The martial arts world, including our Namgung Sega, owes a great debt to Breaking the Sky Sword Saint for generations. If there's anything you want, just tell me."<br>
What's his intention?<br>
While I was thinking for a moment, Yoo Jonghyuk spoke first.<br>
"We need a doctor who can repair the incarnation body."<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk's judgment was not bad. I don't know what their scheme is, but at this point, using Namgung Sega was the best way.<br>
"I'll call for Shinui through my family."<br>
Shinui. If we could call them, it was one of the best options for now.<br>
Because 'Shinui' was one of the few 'Story Experts' who could repair stories in the 'First Murim'.<br>
"And also..."<br>
"But why are you looking for a doctor? The boy doesn't seem to have any internal or external injuries."<br>
For a moment, he thought he had leaked too much information. Yoo Jonghyuk's expression hardened, and just as he was about to say something,<br>
"Is it you who needs a doctor, or is it the friend hiding in your pocket?"<br>
I had no choice but to admit it. We underestimated the Emperor's Sword too much.<br>
Still, it was a group of incarnations that could block 'high-ranking constellations', and I thought they wouldn't find out about my existence.<br>
Before Yoo Jonghyuk made a mistake, I got out of Yoo Jonghyuk's pocket and released 'Thoughts'.<br>
"I was rude."<br>
Watching me bow, the Emperor's Sword Namgung Jincheon slowly got up from his seat. A strange color flashed across his eyes.<br>
If it had been the case, it would have been a welcome sight, but it wasn’t like that now.<br>
"I know you."<br>
Damn, as expected.<br>
"Your story is famous even in this 'Murim'."<br>
Honestly, I was afraid of what kind of story would spread. However, the expression on Jewanggeom’s face as he opened his mouth wasn’t all that bad.<br>
"The story of you persuading Cheongae of the Dragon Head and sending them back to the sky made the whole of Gangho buzz."<br>
Cheongae of the Dragon Head.<br>
It was a name I hadn’t heard in a long time.<br>
Had the scenario from Seoul Station already spread here?<br>
"It hasn’t been widely known yet, but I also know that you recently had a fierce battle with the 'Master of the Spear' at the Recycling Center."<br>
Something came to mind belatedly.<br>
'Master of the Spear' was once the patron saint of the Namgung family. And I killed him at the 'Recycling Center'.<br>
However, Jewanggeom seemed happy about that fact.<br>
"I’m grateful to you."<br>
That made sense. The 'Master of the Spear' was the first constellation to run away when the 'Outer God Incident' broke out.<br>
Namgung Sega still hadn't forgotten the grudge from that time.<br>
I nodded and answered.<br>
"I'll accept your thanks. But I don't think you came here to talk about that."<br>
"You're as sharp as I've heard."<br>
The expression on the Emperor Sword's face, which had been slightly smiling, became even more serious.<br>
"I know that the constellations of the Great Nebulae are looking for you."<br>
I squinted my eyes and swallowed my tension.<br>
Honestly, if the Emperor's sword were to report us to <Asgard> or <Olympus> right now, there was nothing we could do.<br>
"I have something to ask you."<br>
However, if that was his purpose, the Emperor's sword wouldn't have come to us separately.<br>
"Are you, in front of me now, the incarnation 'Kim Dokja', or the constellation 'Demon King of Salvation'?"

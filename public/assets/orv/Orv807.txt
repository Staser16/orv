807 Episode 39 Rumor (6)<br>
The 'Recorders of Fear' are crashing into this world in the form of 'possession'?<br>
"Are all the Recorders of Fears like that?"<br>
"I'm not sure either."<br>
With that thought, several cases came to mind.<br>
One was 'Bicheonhori' that I met at the 'Recycling Center', and the other was me and other readers.<br>
If the characteristic of 'possession' itself is a characteristic of the Recorders of Fear...<br>
"However, there is this saying. The 'Recorders of Fear' appear and disappear as if they are invading the world line."<br>
They appear and disappear as if they are invading the world line.<br>
I asked, repeating that expression to myself.<br>
"What is their purpose?"<br>
"Well. I guess it's to interpret 'fear'?"<br>
Fear. That word, which had been repeated before, now sounded unfamiliar.<br>
"What on earth is this 'fear' that they are talking about?"<br>
"If it could be explained that simply, the name 'Recorder of Fear' wouldn't have existed in the first place."<br>
"Can't you understand it even in a general way?"<br>
"In a general way..."<br>
The story expert began to calmly organize the place he had used. He swept away the story fragments that were scattered in a chaotic manner and neatly put the brushes he had used into his brush. The reason all of his actions seemed to have some meaning was probably because he was a story expert.<br>
The story expert finally finished organizing and opened his mouth.<br>
"What do you think is the greatest story that makes up this world?"<br>
I answered without thinking for long.<br>
"I think it's a 'scenario'."<br>
Everything in this world is made up of 'stories.' And the biggest flow that leads those stories was the 'scenario' hosted by the <Star Stream>.<br>
Tsutsutsut.<br>
I can tell just by looking at the fact that my existence is soon in danger.<br>
This universe is a world where you are granted a 'qualification' just by participating in a scenario. Satisfied with my answer, the story expert nodded and smiled.<br>
"Then where do you think that 'scenario' came from?"<br>
"That's..."<br>
Here, saying that it was actually written by a writer named Han Sooyoung wouldn't be of much help.<br>
Also, even if the designer of the scenario was Han Sooyoung, that wasn't the logical probability that supported this world.<br>
There must be scenarios in this world that Han Sooyoung didn't write.<br>
In addition, Han Sooyoung didn't know all the content of the scenarios from birth.<br>
She must have written the scenarios based on what she learned from other content and her own experiences.<br>
When I thought about it that far, I felt strange. When I thought about it, all the 'great story scenarios' I knew were familiar.<br>
Olympus' <Gigantomachia>.<br>
Eden and the Demon World's <The Great Battle of  Demon>.<br>
The Emperor's <Journey to the West>.<br>
They were all scenarios based on famous stories.<br>
And that's not all? The general scenarios were the same. A battle royale survival game, or a variation of a mafia game.<br>
In the end, scenarios are based on existing 'stories'.<br>
"Aren't most scenarios based on old 'tales'?"<br>
The  nodded again, but didn't smile. It meant that my answer was incomplete.<br>
"That's right. To be more precise."<br>
The god blinked for a moment as if choosing his words, then opened his mouth.<br>
"All scenarios are 'interpreted tales'."<br>
Interpreted tales.<br>
A bright light flashed in my head.<br>
"A very small interpretation of a tale can sometimes change the entire universe."<br>
The nodded again and smiled.<br>
"I see you understand now."<br>
"Are the recorders of fear the ones who interpret 'uninterpreted tales'?"<br>
"That's what I think."<br>
"Those tales are 'fears'."<br>
Uninterpreted stories are difficult. They are unfamiliar, and sometimes even incomprehensible. The source of that incomprehensibility is fear.<br>
"Even this <Star Stream> has not yet been able to interpret the tales, the Recorders of Fear love such stories."<br>
'Secretive Plotter' suddenly came to mind.<br>
Perhaps the Recorders of Fear admired him because he was the 'uninterpretable being' of all people in this world.<br>
"I heard you are participating in the Fear Expedition this time."<br>
"Yes, that is what happened."<br>
The story expert looked at me with a slightly complicated expression and was about to open his mouth again when.<br>
"The Lord of the House calls."<br>
At the perfect timing, the guard opened the door and appeared. The guard's gaze was unusual, as if he had been eavesdropping on our conversation.<br>
The story expert Lowellyn sighed lightly and looked at me, mouthing.<br>
—I tried to keep you alive, so don't die.<br>
I nodded my head in gratitude.<br>
*<br>
The conversation with the story expert was beneficial in its own way.<br>
The most important thing was the information I gained about the 'Recorders of Fear.'<br>
「Maybe me and other readers are also destined to eventually become 'recorders of fear'.」<br>
I decided not to think too deeply about it. Because the information I could know right now was too limited. For now, it was important to deal with the immediate issues one by one.<br>
Steadily, like writing one sentence and then writing the next.<br>
If every moment of my life becomes a story, then eventually this moment will also be written as a story.<br>
In order not to leave this moment as a vague 'fear', I had to keep thinking and moving.<br>
When Yoo Jonghyuk finished his breakfast, the escorting person came to see us again.<br>
"The expedition team will be announced soon. I think the guests should come with us."<br>
After discussing with the head of the household, we decided to participate in the 'Fear Expedition' as representatives of the Namgung family.<br>
[A new main scenario is about to begin!]<br>
My heart raced at the thought of finally entering a new scenario. I don't know if it was because I was scared or nervous. I pretended to talk to Yoo Jonghyuk to hide my trembling.<br>
"You suddenly had a trance ritual while listening to the words of the story expert. Did you gain some kind of enlightenment?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk shook his head at my question.<br>
"I thought you had transcended."<br>
"If transcending could happen that easily, the martial arts world would already be full of transcendent beings."<br>
"Well, I guess so."<br>
"I have a habit of having a trance ritual whenever I feel like it. I can't miss even the smallest hint of enlightenment."<br>
I realized once again how sincere Yoo Jonghyuk is. No matter how often he acts like a transcendent, Yoo Jonghyuk is fundamentally a transcendent who works hard.<br>
He must have lived so diligently to become the ultimate transcendent after going through 1,863 regressions.<br>
[Your understanding of the character 'Yoo Jonghyuk' has increased.]<br>
[The character 'Yoo Jonghyuk' shows you a little favor.]<br>
I was startled by the message that suddenly came.<br>
My understanding has suddenly increased?<br>
"Why?"<br>
"It's nothing."<br>
I had to bite my lips several times to hide my expression.<br>
When I first met him, I thought he would never be my comrade.<br>
That was understandable, because 'Yoo Jonghyuk of the 41st round' was considered one of the worst Yoo Jonghyuks among the many Yoo Jonghyuks.<br>
And yet, I was able to gain a little favor from him. That alone felt like enough compensation for my 'martial arts journey'.<br>
"Now that we've entered the realm of fear, you won't throw me off a cliff, right?"<br>
"What nonsense are you talking about?"<br>
I just shrugged.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk glared at me with a strange expression and added.<br>
"It seems like you've made some progress."<br>
"Did you notice?"<br>
As expected, the eyes of the regressor cannot be avoided.<br>
In fact, there was progress for me. Not something profound like enlightenment, but progress that was obvious enough to be seen right away.<br>
[Congratulations! Your story has successfully evolved!]<br>
[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' has evolved into a mythical-level story!]<br>
Finally, 'Heir to the Eternal Name' has become a mythical-level story.<br>
I don't know why this story suddenly evolved. Maybe the story, worried that I would soon die, evolved on its own.<br>
[The story 'Heir to the Eternal Name' snorts.]<br>
Or maybe it was helpful that I spent the whole night wondering about 'Kim Dokja' after talking to the story expert yesterday.<br>
In any case, with this, I finally became the owner of a 'mythical-level story'.<br>
And the next moment, a bright light began to flow out from Kim Dokja's smartphone.<br>
[The function of the Holy Relic has evolved!]<br>
The function of the Holy Relic has evolved.<br>
Maybe this is the first effect of the 'mythical tale'.<br>
As soon as I turned on my smartphone, the platform screen appeared first.<br>
+<br>
…<br>

Episode ◼️◼️. ◼️◼️ (◼️) +[??]<br>
Episode ◼️◼️. ◼️◼️ (◼️) +[??]<br>
…<br>
+<br>
Why can't I see the latest episode?<br>
I pressed refresh several times, but the screen didn't change.<br>
What happened to the serialization record? Or—<br>
「Uninterpreted story.」<br>
My head felt dizzy.<br>
I'm now an exile, outside the scenario.<br>
If that's why this moment was 'uninterpreted'. So what if these episodes aren't visible?<br>
It was a plausible assumption, but it wasn't yet certain.<br>
Above all, there was one thing left to check.<br>
[You can check one comment for the desired chapter using the 'Daily Free Pass'.]<br>
Fortunately, I could still check the comments. Does that mean the series was proceeding normally?<br>
I'll know when I check the comments.<br>
[Now, you can check the 'comments with many recommendations' first without using coins.]<br>
[Would you like to use the 'Daily Free Pass'?]<br>
An unexpected suggestion. It seemed that this was an effect added through 「Heir to the Eternal Name」.<br>
Up until now, it was difficult to gather information efficiently because of the 'random comment confirmation system'.<br>
That's understandable, because when you check comments randomly, it was difficult to avoid comments that randomly spammed Yoo Jonghyuk's name or the Demon King of Salvation's name.<br>
However, if I could see only comments with many 'recommendations', it would be a different story. The fact that it was recommended by many readers means that there is a high probability that it has hit the core of that 'chapter'. Above all, it is highly likely that it will avoid meaningless comments. Of course, there was a function to check 'recommended comments' using additional coins in the past, but as the cost increases with each chapter (after chapter 200, it started to demand a whopping 10,000 coins per comment), recently I hardly ever checked the 'recommended comments'.<br>
But they're releasing that feature for free. I couldn't miss this opportunity.<br>
[One free daily ticket will be deducted.]<br>
[Check the comment with the most 'recommendations'.]<br>
I checked the comments right away.<br>
Well, indeed.<br>

Recommended 195 / Not recommended 10<br>
+<br>
I stared at the empty ◼️ part between 'Eung' and 'i' for a moment.<br>
I thought that uninterpreted stories are scary, but uninterpreted comments might be scary too. That must be it?<br>
Why on earth did this comment get the most upvotes?<br>
I can't understand what Kim Dokja is thinking right now.<br>
I checked the second comment.<br>

Hmm.<br>
Fortunately, the third most upvoted comment was open to interpretation.<br>
+<br>
—Jin◼️Isn't this dead?<br>
Recommended 98 / Not recommended 3<br>
+<br>
Sometimes, comments are scarier when interpreted.<br>
「Isn't this really how I die?」<br>
I blankly stared at the comment, then suddenly went back to the first comment and checked how many times '엉◼️이' was used.<br>
It was 41 times in total.<br>
At that moment, a series of keywords came together in my head.<br>
엉◼️이, 41. 팡◼️. He's not really going to die like this?<br>
Wait a minute, this can't be.<br>
I reflexively looked around and muttered.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk."<br>
And then the real fear began.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk?"<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk disappeared.

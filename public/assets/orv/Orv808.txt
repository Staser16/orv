808 Episode 39 Rumor (7)<br>
I felt anxious. If the 'comments' I just saw were true, something terrible would happen to Yoo Jonghyuk from now on.<br>
Surprised by the disappearance of Yoo Jonghyuk, who was escorted with me, I hurriedly ordered someone to search the area.<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk!"<br>
I called Yoo Jonghyuk's name several times.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk could die. No, maybe he's already dead. If that happens-<br>
"Yoo Jonghyuk?"<br>
And after a while, the guy's head appeared between the crowd.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, who appeared with one of his escorts, was glaring at me with his characteristically sullen eyes.<br>
"What?"<br>
"No, what if you suddenly disappear like that?"<br>
"There were some Murim dumplings nearby."<br>
When I looked closely, I saw a small dumpling in the guy's mouth.<br>
No, really, because of that?<br>
"This restaurant's Murim dumplings have inherited some of the original recipes. It's my favorite restaurant."<br>
In the main story, Yoo Jonghyuk disappeared because of dumplings.<br>
The reason Yoo Jonghyuk eats Murim dumplings every time he visits Murim is probably because of his memories of Pacheon Sword Master.<br>
Every time he swallows one of those dumplings, Yoo Jonghyuk must be constantly reminiscing about those days.<br>
In short, that ritual is a necessary procedure for Yoo Jonghyuk to live while remembering the past rounds.<br>
"Even if you look at it that way, I don't think I'll give it to you."<br>
"I won't eat it."<br>
I don't know. It seems like he just eats because he has to eat eight meals.<br>
The guards guarding him also seemed somewhat surprised at the sight of little Yoo Jonghyuk eating. It made sense since he was eating two dumplings in one bite.<br>
"Yoo , it's difficult if you disappear like that so suddenly."<br>
It was clear what they were thinking just from the looks the guards exchanged.<br>
「Is that guy really a disciple of  Sword ?"」<br>
After a while, we arrived at Cheongryongseong Square. In the center of the square, a huge banner with the words '191st Terror Expedition' was fluttering.<br>
[The main scenario area is nearby.]<br>
The Namgung Sega's unmanned personnel pointed to the entrance of the venue and said.<br>
"The head of the family is waiting inside."<br>
The inside of the venue was already crowded with people. Participants in the 'Terror Expedition'. And the incarnations who came to see them off or watch them.<br>
"The leader of this expedition is from Namgung Sega?"<br>
"So the leader of the expedition is Namgung Myeong, the head of the small family?"<br>
"That's the rumor. How could that be? There's no way that a promising star of Sega would participate in a scenario where they're going to die..."<br>
I tried to ignore the ominous words. In any case, entering the 'main scenario' was the priority right now.<br>
We stepped into the venue without hesitation. To be exact, that was what we were going to do.<br>
[You are not allowed to enter the 'event venue'.]<br>
What?<br>
[You are an ''.]<br>
[You are not allowed to enter the venue without proof of identity.]<br>
It was a disconcerting message.<br>
It's not another scenario, but 'proof of identity' is required for the 'Terror Expedition'?<br>
Did they find the spark flowing through my body? I saw the gatekeepers guarding the venue running towards me.<br>
Fortunately, the guards of Namgung Se-ga came forward.<br>
"Step back. He is a distinguished guest of Namgung Sega. The guards were ordered by the Sega family to allow him to participate in the competition!"<br>
The guards did not back down easily despite the threats of the guards.<br>
"Even if he is a guest of Namgung Sega, we cannot allow '' in. That is the rules of the venue."<br>
I realized once again how exile are treated in the 'scenario area'.<br>
"Can Namgung guarantee that this person is not an extremely evil criminal?"<br>
"Even if you are a criminal, you know that you can participate in the 'Terror Expedition' if you have the permission of the Five Great Segae, right?”<br>
"If the target is an 'exile', then it’s a little different. If an exile has flowed in here, then he is definitely not an ordinary being. What if he is a great villain who has incurred the wrath of the constellations?"<br>
The gatekeepers, who were glaring at me with sharp eyes, showed no sign of yielding.<br>
Meanwhile, a shout was heard from inside the hall.<br>
"The inaugural speech has begun!"<br>
If this were to continue, I would miss all the scenario participation orders.<br>
I quickly nodded to Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
—Go in first.<br>
—Then you,<br>
—I’ll find a way to get in somehow. You should go in first and get a feel for the atmosphere inside the hall.<br>
Yoo Jonghyuk, who had been thinking for a moment, nodded.<br>
—Don’t be late.<br>
Following that, the Namgung Segae’s warriors bowed to me and disappeared into the hall with Yoo Jonghyuk.<br>
One of them said to me,<br>
"I will inform the lord of the situation. Please wait a moment."<br>
I nodded, but I felt strange inside.<br>
Could it be that the Emperor Sword Namgung Jincheon had not anticipated this situation?<br>
In the first place, the 'Gongpyeongyeong Expedition' was an event that he and the Five Great Sega had planned together.<br>
But he knew that I was an 'Exiled One', yet he couldn't prevent my entry control in advance?<br>
Suddenly, I had a bad feeling.<br>
What if the Emperor Sword's purpose was to separate me and Yoo Jonghyuk?<br>
[You are an 'Exiled One'.]<br>
[You cannot enter the venue without proof of identity.]<br>
I shook my head vigorously.<br>
Even if it was a trap, there was nothing I could do. Even the incarnation that the god had fixed wouldn't last long. It would be a waste of time to wander around looking for another 'main scenario' now.<br>
I had to find a way to enter the venue.<br>
"Is there no way for the Exiled One to enter?"<br>
The gatekeepers looked at each other as if they were troubled by my question, and answered in a somewhat sharp voice.<br>
"If there is a constellation that can vouch for you, an exile."<br>
Constellation?<br>
Judging from the expressions on the gatekeepers' faces, they seemed to think there would be no constellation that could vouch for me.<br>
A constellation's vouch.<br>
I looked up at the pale sky and thought of constellations that could help me. There were modifiers that came to mind, but I wasn't sure if they would see me, who had been kicked out of the scenario.<br>
In addition, most of the constellations in that sky were hostile to me. If they knew I was here, there would be more of them who would come down to kill me, not to mention vouch for me.<br>
However, I couldn't delay any longer.<br>
I had to enter the stadium using [Incite] or some other trick.<br>
Finally, I made up my mind and was about to activate [Incite].<br>
"Those guys—"<br>
The entrance to the stadium was tumultuous. It was a crowd of unmanned people who had just started to enter. They seemed to be martial artists from the old village.<br>
"I'm looking forward to this expedition."<br>
"Is 'that' going to go too?"<br>
"Wow, is it the old days? Well, this is a chance to restore the status of the fallen sect."<br>
I watched the martial artists wearing splendid robes as they entered. Judging from their attire, they seemed to be masters of the Jeongpa.<br>
"It's Shaolin!"<br>
"There's a shaman too!"<br>
Shaolin, Hwasan, shaman... Masters of sects I'd only heard of through rumors were entering the competition hall one by one.<br>
But at the end of the line, there was a man in a familiar outfit.<br>
At first, I couldn't tell who he was. But when I looked at him once, twice, three times, I vaguely knew who he was.<br>
His face was different, but it was unmistakable.<br>
More than anything, the story inside me was testifying to him.<br>
At that moment, a middle-aged man who recognized me opened his eyes wide and opened his mouth.<br>
"You are..."<br>
There was.<br>
In this desolate First Murim, the one and only constellation that would guarantee my identity.<br>
*<br>
[You have entered the new 'Main Scenario' area.]<br>
[The 'Exile Penalty' is removed.]<br>
[The new 'Main Scenario' has arrived!]<br>
The air of the 'Scenario' has finally returned.<br>
I was moved anew as I felt the refreshing breath of the story. This was the feeling of being alive—the feeling of clearly standing on my feet and living in the story.<br>
I wanted to check the scenario content right away, but I had to express my gratitude first.<br>
"Thank you very much."<br>
The middle-aged man who waved his hand with a friendly smile on his face. The story inside me reacted again.<br>
[The story 'persistent martial arts master' shivers in joy.]<br>
The middle-aged man who sensed the story nodded as if he was impressed.<br>
"It seems it is listening to you now."<br>
"You have been very helpful."<br>
The 「persistent martial arts master」 was once this middle-aged man's story.<br>
"This is the first time we met since Seoul Station."<br>
He was the former head of Seoul Station, and the 'last ark' of the Beggar Sect, the constellation.<br>
The dragon's head ark 'Cheon-gae'.<br>
[The constellation 'last ark' expresses its joy to you.]<br>
The events that happened at Seoul Station flashed through my mind like a panorama.<br>
A constellation that wanted to step down from being a constellation and start the 'scenarios' from the beginning again.<br>
That constellation, along with its incarnation, appeared before my eyes.<br>
"Your divine power has been revealed."<br>
"It's thanks to you."<br>
He said that, but in fact, the feeling I got from Cheon-gae wasn't as good as before.<br>
That was natural.<br>
At that time, Cheon-gae was caught up in the aftermath of the probability related to the 'god of the other world' and paid a huge price.<br>
"It seems you've been through a lot without me knowing."<br>
I answered with a bitter smile.<br>
Perhaps Cheon-gae and I were in a position to understand each other better than anyone else right now.<br>
In a sense, we were both 'fallen constellations'.<br>
"Didn't the Ark come to participate in this scenario?"<br>
"I said so, to keep the agreement of the Beggar Sect. I came back to where I have an agreement to keep."<br>
Cheon-gae, who was once one of the best in the 'First Murim', was pushed out of Murim after losing to 'Paradox Baek-cheong' and 'Pacheon Sword Saint' in succession.<br>
"I have decided to rewrite the history of my heaven from here. In the world where I fell and escaped."<br>
"You have made a big decision."<br>
A decision that only a constellation who has acknowledged his own failure can make. Nevertheless, his expression was brighter than ever.<br>
"I thought that in order to understand my opponents, I needed to know the trials they overcame."<br>
"So you participated in the 'Gong-ho-ryeong Expedition'?"<br>
After hearing the explanation, I understood why he had no choice but to participate in this expedition.<br>
「Gong-ho-ryeong is the cradle and grave of the Transcendents.」<br>
That 'Gong-ho-ryeong' was the only entrance to the 'Dark Dimension' in this Murim. And the transcendentalists known in Murim were mostly from that 'dark dimension'.<br>
The same goes for the paradoxical Baekcheong   and the Pacheon Sword Master Namgung Minyoung.<br>
"That's right. By the way, since you came all the way here, I guess your circumstances are also difficult."<br>
He seemed to have guessed why I had participated in the 'Fortress Expedition'.<br>
"There are many constellations that support you, including me."<br>
"That's something to be thankful for."<br>
"Of course, there are more constellations that want to kill you."<br>
I replied with a bitter smile.<br>
"I've heard the general rumor. That you defeated all the zodiac signs at the 'Recycling Center'."<br>
"It seems a bit exaggerated."<br>
"I also heard that you summoned otherworldly deities with just your three-inch tongue and had a big fight with the constellations."<br>
Those 'otherworldly deities' were probably from <Kim Dokja Company>.<br>
But they weren't called by me; they just came looking for me.<br>
"I also heard that you poked holes in the stomachs of the constellations that were obsessed with you."<br>
And it wasn't me who did it, it was the stabbing monster, Jaehwan...<br>
"You made a resolution with the naked man who shouted destruction….."<br>
That's right, we went together…<br>
"When I heard that you summoned the archangels and demon kings and tried to recreate the 'Holy Demon War' and destroy the <Star Stream>… I was really shocked."<br>
Some strange rumor is spreading.

820 Episode 41 Sophistry (4)<br>
Her eyes widened as she found me sitting in the seat.<br>
"You."<br>
Her blond hair swayed in the wind. Her eyes shook as if she was agitated.<br>
I waved my hand lightly at her and smiled.<br>
"It's been a while."<br>
I never thought we would meet in a place like this.<br>
Her expression hardened at my greeting, and she hesitated for a moment before approaching me briskly.<br>
"Cheon Inho."<br>
The person who called me 'Cheon Inho'.<br>
"Why are you here?"<br>
Prophet Anna Croft.<br>
She was in the same 'Fear' as me.<br>
*<br>
As I live, there will come a day when I ride the same subway as Anna Croft.<br>
I thought about my last encounter with her. The last time I saw her was at the 'Washington Dome'.<br>
At that time, I fell into 'Gingagap', a trap set by <Asgard>, and there, I borrowed the power of the Demon King of Salvation and defeated the great constellations. Come to think of it, I owed Anna Croft that time. If she hadn’t processed the 'lower dragon heart' with her own trait, neither I nor the Demon King of Salvation would have been able to summon the power of 'Cheok Junkyung' as a [bookmark].<br>
Now that I think about it, Cheok Junkyung is here too. I don’t know if it was a coincidence or not, but things were going quite strangely.<br>
I pointed to the seat next to me and said to Anna Croft.<br>
"Please sit down."<br>
Anna Croft hesitated for a moment, as if she was uncomfortable sitting next to me, and then sat down with a helpless expression.<br>
"What are you planning here?"<br>
"I’m not planning anything in particular."<br>
"What are you planning—"<br>
The moment we got to that point in the conversation, I felt the gaze I had felt the other time.<br>
「On the sub way」<br>
Oh, again.<br>
「You’re tal king too loud ly」<br>
My stomach started to churn and I felt faint dizziness.<br>
[Exclusive skill 'Fourth Wall' is activated.]<br>
Fortunately, I had already experienced it once, and the [Fourth Wall] was also activated, so I could endure it.<br>
But it seemed that Anna Croft was not like that.<br>
"W-what is this?"<br>
Anna Croft, whose face had turned pale, was already sweating profusely.<br>
Even she, who had a fairly high level of mental barrier, could end up like that.<br>
"Lower your voice."<br>
As I whispered, the gazes around her disappeared as if they had been washed away.<br>
Anna Croft, panting and wiping away her sweat, asked.<br>
"What was that just now?"<br>
"Probably a fear effect."<br>
The subway we were riding in had not yet experienced the 'Crime Zone'.<br>
Judging from the fact that a similar phenomenon occurred when I called and when I spoke to Anna Croft—this place seemed to be a space dominated by the common 'Yeong-ui-byeong-jeol' of public transportation.<br>
It could be something like this. Do not talk loudly or make noise. Do not eat food.<br>
Do not make noise.<br>
Give up your seat to pregnant women or the elderly.<br>
Anna Croft also seemed to have noticed the rules.<br>
"A peculiar rule is in effect."<br>
"It's an ordinary rule. This was normal before the scenarios came."<br>
We sat side by side and admired the everyday scenery that we had forgotten. The soft breathing of people. People looking down and concentrating on the small screen.<br>
It felt real again. This was the ordinary world we knew. People in those days were trapped in their own worlds, and perhaps the scenario pulled them out of there.<br>
'Scenarios' that Kim Dokja had read.<br>
I glanced over and saw that Anna Croft was also lost in a short reflection.<br>
She must have sensed my gaze, but she came to her senses and said in a cold voice.<br>
"I knew you were alive, but you're much better than I thought."<br>
Anna Croft seemed to have already heard the news about me.<br>
"You're glad I'm okay, aren't you?"<br>
"No one can go through something like that and be fine."<br>
"Have you heard any rumors?"<br>
"I heard that you were chased by giant nebulae and torn apart."<br>
Torn apart.<br>
That's not wrong.<br>
I was not the one who was 'torn apart' to begin with.<br>
"Wow, it almost turned out like that."<br>
"You're so tenacious that you survived that kind of defeat."<br>
"Because I'm good at coming back from the dead. But why did you come here?"<br>
"Are you really asking because you don't know?"<br>
A thought occurred to me belatedly.<br>
The last time I saw Anna Croft, she went against her own Nebula, <Asgard>, to help me.<br>
I knew what the incarnation that went against the nebulae would say.<br>
"You seem to be blooming too."<br>
"Thanks to who? I was going to ask you about it at the recycling center anyway..."<br>
"Um, I didn't see you there?"<br>
"I didn't know you were a crazy person who wanted to clear it all the way."<br>
"Did you come all the way to the Fear Realm to chase me?"<br>
"Look here. Do I look like someone who's free?"<br>
"Then why did you come to the Fear Realm?"<br>
"I'm not the incarnation of <Asgard> anymore. What choice would an abandoned incarnation have?"<br>
"Aha, you're thinking of becoming a Transcendent."<br>
The only path left for her abandoned by <Asgard>.<br>
Anna Croft had come here to climb the only ladder of social mobility that a mortal abandoned by the constellations could attempt.<br>
"I think that's also a failure since I came all the way here to meet you."<br>
"Come on, let's forget about the old days and get along. That's how we'll get out of here. We'll go out and become Transcendents, and take revenge on the constellations . Anyway, let's go on good terms."<br>
Anna Croft muttered as if she was shocked at what I said.<br>
"On good terms? Do you think that's possible between you and me?"<br>
"I've become a colleague with Yoo Joonghyuk. I'll embrace you with a big heart."<br>
"Who's talking to whom right now—"<br>
Anna Croft, who was about to shout, suddenly stopped talking. The passengers' eyes were turned towards her.<br>
Anna Croft asked again, sighing as if she was going to collapse.<br>
"Cheon Inho. Do you know anything about this 'horror'?"<br>
I nodded and briefly relayed the information I knew.<br>
Anna Croft nodded after hearing my story.<br>
"I expected it since the background was the subway. Then I guess we'll have to create a dangerous zone to get out of here."<br>
"I'm against it."<br>
"Against it?"<br>
"We have to find a way to get out without activating the dangerous zone."<br>
"Didn't you say that the method is unknown? With your abilities, you could easily be the last one standing even if you use the 'danger zone'."<br>
"You were on board with me, of all people."<br>
Anna Croft looked momentarily flustered.<br>
"Because of me?"<br>
"The Cheon Inho of this world line is quite affectionate."<br>
"You always said that and aimed for my back."<br>
"Cheok Junkyung is riding in the next car."<br>
"Cheok… Junkyung?"<br>
"Do you know Goryeo’s Swordsman?"<br>
"Oh, no way—"<br>
Only then did Anna Croft's face turn pale as if she realized the situation.<br>
"We're dead."<br>
"That's why I need your ability now."<br>
Come to think of it, it was my good fortune to meet Anna Croft now. Anna Croft was the incarnation with the ability specialized in this 'Fear Realm'.<br>
"Can you see something in [Future Sight]?"<br>
Anna Croft can read the future with [Future Vision]. This means that if she uses her ability well, she can also power up the threatening fear that will come in the future.<br>
But Anna Croft's expression was unusual.<br>
"No."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"My [Future Sight] lost its power after coming here."<br>
Anna Croft glared at me for a moment as if she didn't want to admit it, then added,<br>
"It's as if the entire future is covered in fog."<br>
This was unexpected.<br>
She can't see the future. Why?<br>
Looking back, there were several times in the main story when 'Anna Croft's' prophetic ability was blocked.<br>
Why was that?<br>
Oh... Wait a minute. Could it be?<br>
A hypothesis suddenly came to mind.<br>
To verify that hypothesis, I reviewed Han Sooyoung's guide once again. But why?<br>
[Some spoilers in this document have been removed.]<br>
Some sentences that were previously marked as 'spoilers' have been released.<br>
+<br>
A common experience was observed in all passengers who survived without using the 'crime zone' in the subway.<br>
All passengers who successfully escaped stated that 「the subway lights blinked three times」.<br>
+<br>
The subway lights blinked three times.<br>
It was an incredibly crucial hint. So, what I have to do is make the subway lights blink three times.<br>
Should I cause a power outage?<br>
"Cheon Inho."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Is that how you see it?"<br>
Anna Croft tilted her head slightly, so I hurriedly hid my phone and answered.<br>
"I just read some web novels."<br>
"Novels? You're reading novels in this situation? Are you crazy?"<br>
Anna Croft glared at me like she was looking at a bug, then made a resigned expression.<br>
"I used to read a lot of novels, too."<br>
At that moment, my vision went black for a moment and then came back. My mind was blank.<br>
What? What just happened?<br>
Anna Croft also looked surprised. She hurriedly looked around and muttered quietly.<br>
"Is it a power outage?"<br>
My mind felt brighter at the word power outage.<br>
"Anna Croft. Please continue what you were just saying."<br>
"What are you talking about? A power outage?"<br>
"No, you were talking about novels."<br>
"What’s the big deal about that right now—"<br>
"Listen to me."<br>
Anna Croft nodded her head slightly at my serious tone.<br>
"But what else do I have to say…"<br>
"Hmm."<br>
I realized that this person is also quite inexperienced at having conversations.<br>
After all, she is a 'prophet'.<br>
A being who can read the past and the future. In a sense, she is a character as 'omniscient' as Kim Dokja.<br>
Would a prophet who knows all of someone’s shortcomings and secrets before they even become close to her really make an effort to build deep relationships with others?<br>
Perhaps all humans would look like characters with past and future plots in front of her.<br>
Thinking about it that way, I could finally understand Anna Croft’s attitude toward her colleagues.<br>
Fortunately, I am a more social person than Kim Dokja or Anna Croft.<br>
"Do you have a favorite author?"<br>
"Ah."<br>
Anna Croft nodded belatedly and answered.<br>
"There is."<br>
"Who is it?"<br>
"Ted Chang, Charles Yu, Liu Cixin. And…"<br>
I smiled, feeling like I expected it.<br>
Well, Anna wouldn't read web novels.<br>
Anna Croft let out a snarl, interpreting my smile.<br>
"Are you making fun of my reading tastes?"<br>
"No, I just laughed because I thought it suited you well."<br>
"Who do you like?"<br>
"My favorite author."<br>
I muttered, looking at the letters shining on the screen of my smartphone.<br>
"It's someone named Han Sooyoung."<br>
Anna Croft muttered, "Han Sooyoung," and tilted her head.<br>
"I've never heard of that author before. Is she a famous author in Korea?"<br>
"In what worldline?"<br>
Anna Croft tilted her head for a moment, as if imagining a worldline where Han Sooyoung is famous.<br>
In the meantime, I was staring at the ceiling light. The light was flickering, emitting an uncertain light that seemed to be fading.<br>
It was almost like a blink, which was a pity.<br>
Is this not enough?<br>
In that case, I had no choice but to resort to a desperate measure.<br>
"Anna Croft, what role will I assign you from now on?"<br>
"Yes?"<br>
"You are Korean from now on and your name is Kim Anna."<br>
"What?"<br>
"Ms. Kim Anna. Do you speak Spanish?"<br>
Kim Anna looked at me with her typical bewildered expression, then answered as if she had no choice but to follow along.<br>
"I know a little bit."<br>
"Puede prestarme dinero."<br>
Kim Anna asked back with a dumbfounded expression.<br>
"Why are you suddenly asking me to lend you money?"<br>
"Do you have any apps you can recommend for me?"<br>
"Apps?"<br>
"Like apps to learn Spanish."<br>
"Cheon Inho. What the hell are you talking about?"<br>
"Inho has an Inho's life."<br>
"What?"<br>
"And Anna has an Anna's life."<br>
At that moment, the lights flickered again.<br>
I felt a surge of joy inside.<br>
As expected, my guess was right.<br>
Anna Croft asked back in a bewildered voice.<br>
"What did you do just now?"<br>
"Be quiet."<br>
It was clear now.<br>
I muttered as I looked back at the passengers. I don’t know if it was one of them or someone outside this space.<br>
"We’re being 'audited' right now."<br>
Someone was watching us here.<br>
"What—"<br>
"Do you remember what the first scenario was?"<br>
The first scenario was about 'killing a living being'.<br>
The name of the scenario was 'Proof of Worth'.<br>
Proof of Worth.<br>
Every incarnation had to prove their 'worth' to 'someone' through the first scenario.<br>
Anna, who had been looking around, asked with a hardened expression.<br>
"No way. The constellations are watching?"<br>
"Not constellations."<br>
"Then?"<br>
"I don’t know. I think we have to make them happy to get out."<br>
The lights had blinked twice so far. And both of those blinks happened when I parodied the development of the 'main story'.<br>
But now there was no more main story content to parody. The situation where even the 'Reader's Life', which was a desperate measure, was used. In terms of the main story development, this was the 'beginning of the scenario'.<br>
It means that the 'Crime Zone' must open.<br>
"Then the 'Crime Zone' is..."<br>
"It would have been the easiest way to entertain someone."<br>
In fact, I had a vague idea of ​​who that 'someone' was.<br>
「At least this horror is related to Kim Dokja.」<br>
In the first place, the only people who would enjoy watching the parody of the main story would be Kim Dokja or Kim Dokja's acquaintances.<br>
Then, the way to make the subway lights blink is simple.<br>
All I had to do was start a story that would make even that 'Kim Dokja' curious.<br>
"Anna Croft."<br>
Fortunately, I was with someone who knew one of those stories.<br>
"I want to know exactly what happened in the last 40th round."<br>
This was also something I was curious about.<br>
Anna Croft asked, lightly puffing out one cheek and then bursting it.<br>
"Cheon Inho. What are you up to? I'd rather ask you about the last round."<br>
"I don't know much because I lost my memories of that round. What happened? What did I do? Why do you and Yoo Joonghyuk hate me so much."<br>
A story I should have found out a long time ago, but kept putting off.<br>
"I don't know anything. That's why I want to know."<br>
Taking a deep breath, an old memory suddenly came to mind.<br>
The red coat. The wings of the Demon King, the being called 'the evil sophist' by the constellations.<br>
The two blades that crossed to kill each other.<br>
Perhaps it was a question I should have asked a long time ago. In order to meet the second Kim Dokja, to become a proper comrade with Yoo Joonghyuk, in order to resolve this 'fear', I—<br>
"Who on earth is 'Cheon Inho' from the 40th round?"<br>
I need to know exactly who I am first.

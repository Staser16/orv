844 Episode 45 Ten Evils (2)<br>
One New Year, Kiyeon once greeted me with these words.<br>
—Listen carefully. The world has been destroyed.<br>
Another new material.<br>
I answered.<br>
—Yes, it seems like your novel has already failed.<br>
—No. I told you to listen carefully.<br>
—It’s a story where I alone start with great powers in the apocalypse.<br>
Kiyeon was startled by my answer and asked.<br>
—How did you know?<br>
—How could I not know?<br>
Now that I think about it, I could talk to Kiyeon quite like Ji Eunyu.<br>
—Wow, this time it’s really different.<br>
Kiyeon grumbled for a while before sending me the introduction he had written.<br>
—Only I can cook in this world.<br>
Unfortunately, Kiyeon’s introduction was never used. That’s because Kiyeon disappeared shortly after. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if Kiyeon had continued writing that cooking novel.<br>
Would that story have been born as a world in another dimension?<br>
Oh, why am I telling you this?<br>
"The One Who Deceived the Stars. How long are you going to keep reading the recipes? If you keep doing this, the king will die."<br>
It's because I feel like I've become the main character of that story now.<br>
I don't know why I have to go through the former route of the 'Murim Dumpling Chef' in the 40th round, but unfortunately, there was a reader who wanted this story.<br>
[The 'King of Fear' is paying attention to your actions.]<br>
What on earth do you want to see, Kim Dokja? Do you really want to see a story about making Murim dumplings?<br>
No. Rather than that, aren't you more curious about the story of Yoo Joonghyuk, who came back to life without eating dumplings, destroying all the constellations in the 40th round, and Cheon Inho, who waved his cheering stick diligently next to him?<br>
[The 'King of Fear' is curious about the 'Murim Dumplings' you made.]<br>
I sighed deeply and read the recipe. How much longer did I read like that?<br>
A message came to my mind.<br>
[Story fragment 'Murim Dumpling Recipe' resonates with you.]<br>
It was the moment when the youngest Kim Dokja finally changed his job to become a 'Murim Dumpling Chef'.<br>
「My name is Manri Shintong Heo Poong. I don't know who you are, but I sincerely thank you for continuing the progress. This 'Murim Dumpling' is an authentic recipe I developed 1,200 years ago…」<br>
Whether it was Heo Poong or Jang Poong, the progress of a great nobleman entered my head.<br>
I bowed in my mind to the invisible dumpling master and then looked at the culprit of this whole situation.<br>
"I'm hungry."<br>
There were now 10 minutes left. I had to make dumplings that Yoo Joonghyuk could eat within 10 minutes. The Ten Evils, who were watching me holding the cooking utensils, asked.<br>
"But do you have the dumpling ingredients?"<br>
"What are you going to do by just reading the recipe when you don't have the ingredients?"<br>
"It's not too late. We have plenty of poison and curse traps."<br>
The Ten Evils' point was right, but also wrong.<br>
This 'Murim dumpling' is not an ordinary food. So the method of making it is not ordinary either.<br>
「The key ingredient of 'Murim dumpling' is 'memory'.」<br>
It is a food made with memory.<br>
I concentrated for a moment and pulled out the fragments of the story from my memory.<br>
"W-what did you do just now?"<br>
"The dumpling skin suddenly appeared out of thin air!"<br>
The dumpling skin was my old memory.<br>
「Ji Eunyu said. "Author! Please make him regress this time! Make him regress! I said you have to make him regress here!"」<br>
For now, I had no choice but to write this memory. If you think about clearing the scenario in the future, you can't use memories related to 'Ways of Survival' or 'Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint' carelessly. Then,<br>
「The only thing I can use now is the memory of 'Lee Hakhyun'.」<br>
Make it like this, make it like that, then fill the inside of the memory as written in the recipe, cook it...<br>
After a while, a steaming dumpling was completed.<br>
[Congratulations! You've completed 'Authentic Murim Dumpling'!]<br>
[Your cooking skill is very low!]<br>
[Your Murim Dumpling completion level is as follows.]<br>
+<br>
Completion level: ★☆☆☆☆<br>
Overall: A dumpling that you wonder if you can eat. The combination of memories is terrible. Beware of side effects.<br>
+<br>
Wow, isn't one star too much? No. Is one star normal for a beginner?<br>
"Huh, how—"<br>
"The Evil Sophist can really make dumplings..."<br>
"These are dumplings that the devil would eat."<br>
I ignored the ten evils and approached Yoo Joonghyuk.<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk muttered while looking at me with a pale face.<br>
"I… keug!”<br>
I stuffed a dumpling into the guy’s mouth so that he couldn’t continue his words.<br>
"Keuheuk."<br>
It suddenly felt as if he was having a seizure and thought he was vomiting blood.<br>
This went on for five minutes. Just as Lee Dansu was about to start raving about the poison, Yoo Joonghyuk suddenly muttered.<br>
"Regression."<br>
Regression?<br>
"Regression right now…"<br>
The Ten Evils ran towards Yoo Joonghyuk, who was strangling himself.<br>
"The Supreme King is trying to commit suicide!"<br>
"Stop it!"<br>
It seems I had inserted a memory that shouldn’t have been inserted.<br>
*<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk recovered quickly.<br>
The food he needed was three dumplings a day. Fortunately, there was no 'story of eating eight meals' because he was a zombie. Three was enough for me to suffer the memory loss penalty.<br>
"You didn't put in any weird memories this time, did you?"<br>
"Yes. Only happy memories."<br>
"But why does that Ji Eunyu keep yelling at you? Is she your enemy?"<br>
It's been three days since Yoo Joonghyuk started eating the dumplings I made. He always looked at me suspiciously, but now he's started eating my dumplings quite well.<br>
The Ten Evils watching us looked confused.<br>
"Damn it, some people are eating dirt, and some are eating dumplings."<br>
"Are you discriminating against people right now?"<br>
But I can't give the Ten Evils the dumplings I made with my memories.<br>
[The proficiency of story fragment 'Murim Dumpling Recipe' increases!]<br>
Huh?<br>
[The incarnation that eats your 'Murim Dumpling' will receive the proficiency bonus effect of skills or stigma.]<br>
I was surprised. No, 'Murim dumplings' have this effect? I hesitated for a moment and glanced at the Ten Evils.<br>
Since it turned out like this, isn't there a way to raise the status of the Ten Evils by feeding them a lot of dumplings?<br>
"Would you like some dumplings?"<br>
As soon as I finished speaking, the Ten Evils all came running and snatched the dumplings from my hand.<br>
"Delicious! Delicious! Damn it!"<br>
"Is this how the tyrant lives? He's a happy guy!"<br>
"I don't think he'd put any deadly poison in them..."<br>
If I knew they'd like it this much, I should've made it for them a long time ago.<br>
It was sad to see four people splitting one dumpling, so I tried to make another one, but Yoo Joonghyuk grabbed my shoulder.<br>
"You, your hands are weird."<br>
"Huh?"<br>
Only after hearing Yoo Joonghyuk's words did I realize that my hands were shaking faintly.<br>
Did I overdo it? I've been making too many dumplings lately.<br>
"If you keep doing that, all your memories will disappear."<br>
"Well, for now, I'll make them into unnecessary memories—"<br>
"There are no unnecessary memories."<br>
It was a bit unexpected that Yoo Joonghyuk said that, so I was speechless for a moment and focused on what he was saying.<br>
"All memories are the foundation of existence. Every memory has its own role to maintain existence."<br>
"That's true, but I don't think it's something someone who sacrificed their memories as a sacrifice for 'Story Imprint' should say."<br>
"That's—"<br>
"You're the one who ate the dumplings I made anyway, so if I forget something, I can just ask you."<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk frowned.<br>
"The dumplings weren't delicious enough to answer all those questions."<br>
"Was it that bad?"<br>
"I definitely knew you weren't Cheon Inho."<br>
Well, since he's been eating dumplings made with my memories, Yoo Joonghyuk must have come to know a little about me now.<br>
That I'm not Cheon Inho, and that I came from a different world line.<br>
"Take care of your memories. You're a possessed being. If the possessor loses his or her memories, the spirit will eventually be consumed by the body."<br>
I had never thought about it that way, but suddenly I felt a little scared.<br>
If I forget all my memories from when I was Lee Hakhyun, what will I become?<br>
"If that happens, please hit me hard on the back of the head."<br>
"Okay."<br>
"This time, you won't say no."<br>
"I think it'd be good to finish this scenario soon."<br>
"How are you going to finish it?"<br>
"The goal of this scenario is 'to destroy the ark and reach the Final Wall'."<br>
"So?"<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk stood up from his seat with a look of 'what's the point of saying more?' and declared while looking at the Ten Evils, who were still picking up dumpling crumbs.<br>
"We're going to attack the ark today."<br>
*<br>
And our attack failed spectacularly.<br>
"Kuaaaaah!"<br>
As soon as he set foot on the ark, 'rumor expert' Kang Ilhun's head was blown off again.<br>
"Damn it! This bastard Ye Hyunwoo is already gone!"<br>
'The one who disappears' Ye Hyunwoo disappeared in an instant.<br>
"Me, a weaker guy than me, come out! Only weaker guys come out!"<br>
There was no constellation weaker than 'strong, weak, strong' Kyung Sein.<br>
"Trap set! Huh... Do these guys not even respond to poison!"<br>
'Ghost Executor' Lee Dansu as committing the foolish act of spraying poison on the constellations.<br>
And yet we had Yoo Joonghyuk. No matter what anyone says, a tyrant is a tyrant. The constellations were shocked.<br>
And what happened?<br>
"Make more dumplings."<br>
I sighed deeply as I watched Yoo Joonghyuk lose one of his arms and legs.<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk was silent for a long time and then said something I hadn't asked.<br>
"This is the first time I've even gotten to the final scenario."<br>
I laughed in vain.<br>
Come to think of it, this kid, Yoo Joonghyuk, hadn't even gotten to the final scenario.<br>
"Well, it wasn't bad for a first attempt."<br>
Although he returned half-paralyzed, Yoo Joonghyuk's inaction was enough to alert the constellations.<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk, who had infiltrated the ark, killed over twenty great-grade constellations and appeared in a half-body form. He achieved the feat of cutting off Ares’s head.<br>
To be honest, it was a great achievement up to that point. Even if Yoo Joonghyuk had been resurrected for the 40th time, I didn’t expect him to show off that much power.<br>
But the moment Zeus’s incarnation was strong, we had no choice but to run away like Ye Hyunwoo.<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk muttered as if his pride was hurt.<br>
"Zeus is a top-tier constellation even among myths. If I had a proper weapon, I could have fought him…"<br>
"So you’re saying that if you have a weapon, it’s okay?"<br>
"At least I can buy some time."<br>
Unfortunately, the weapon that Yoo Joonghyuk currently has is a SS-grade item that is a replica of the sacred relic 'Bangcheonhwageuk'.<br>
If he had the 'Cheongryongeonwoldo' or 'Triana', or even the original of the 'Bangcheonhwageuk', the situation would have been different.<br>
"Procuring weapons isn't necessarily the only way."<br>
"Then?"<br>
"Then?"<br>
"The goal of the scenario is to destroy the 'Ark' anyway. If we can access the 'Story Core', which is the core power source, we don't necessarily have to deal with the <Olympus> guys."<br>
Then, 'The Disappearing One' Ye Hyunwoo appeared from somewhere and tackled him.<br>
"The Story Core of the Ark is guarded by mythical constellations."<br>
"Yes. It was really helpful that you showed up when we really needed it and told us those words."<br>
"And we don't know the schematics for the power facility."<br>
Even if it was said by someone I didn't like, it was true.<br>
Anyway, our immediate tasks were reduced to two.<br>
One, get a weapon for Yoo Joonghyuk.<br>
Two, get a map to the power facility.<br>
I was starting to get tired.<br>
What would happen to us if we didn't clear the 40th round?<br>
[The 'King of Fear' is watching your choice.]<br>
Still, it's fortunate that we can suppress the 'end' until the very end.<br>
I let out a light sigh and asked the Ten Evils.<br>
"Do you have any useful spears?"<br>
No one answered.<br>
I stared at the Ten Evils blankly and took out a dumpling.<br>
"Does anyone have any useful spears?"<br>
Judging from the fact that there was no response even after I gave them the dumplings, it seemed that there really were no useful spears.<br>
Then Lee Dansu, who had been hesitating, stepped forward.<br>
"We don't have any, but I know a guy with a good spear."<br>
"Who is that?"<br>
"I'll tell you if you give me a dumpling."<br>
I lightly threw a dumpling at Lee Dansu. The ten evils screamed, "Damn, I should've told him!" as Lee Dansu took a bite of the dumpling.<br>
I asked Lee Dansu, who happily took a bite of the dumpling.<br>
"Now tell me."<br>
"Blood Demon."<br>
I had forgotten. There were other living incarnations in this world besides us. It seemed like it was time for that incarnation to be of help for the first time.<br>
"What kind of spear does he have?"<br>
"From the Blue Dragon Sword to the Heavenly Sword. I'm sure they have all the relics of a decent level."<br>
I said, jumping up from my seat.<br>
"Let's go and steal them right now."<br>
We've already raided the Ark. Since Yoo Joonghyuk is on our side, there was no reason to be afraid of the Blood Demon.<br>
But the expressions on the group's faces were not good.<br>
"It'll be hard."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Even if all of us go, we can't deal with the Blood Demon gang."<br>
"We have Yoo Joonghyuk. Is Blood Demon the name of a constellation that is on the same level as Zeus?"<br>
Ye Hyunwoo looked at me pitifully and nodded at Yoo Joonghyuk.<br>
"You, don't you know about the traits of the Supreme King?"<br>
"Trait? What trait?"<br>
"The Supreme King's combat power decreases to less than a tenth when fighting against an incarnation."<br>
I quickly used [Character List] to check Yoo Joonghyuk's status.<br>
As expected of the 40th round, Yoo Joonghyuk possessed a number of impressive traits. From 'Ruler of Amusement' to 'Iron-Blooded Supreme King'.<br>
Some of the traits were comparable to those of the 1,863rd round.<br>
However, there was one strange one among them.<br>
+<br>
Trait: Curse of the Stars.<br>
The target's rank increases by two when fighting a constellation. However, when fighting against any kind of 'humanoid incarnation', the rank decreases to a tenth.<br>
+<br>
"Why did you learn this trait?"<br>
"Yoo Joonghyuk didn't learn it."<br>
"Then?"<br>
"It's a trait that came about because of the curse trap you set at the end. Did you forget this too? The reason you were able to defeat the Supreme King is because—"<br>
"Yes, I understand."<br>
What the hell did you do, Cheon Inho?<br>
So the most important force right now is useless in the Blood Demon War.<br>
"Let's make a deal with the Blood Demon."<br>
"You know what he wants, right? Are you willing to offer the Supreme King's head?"<br>
"That would be difficult."<br>
"That's all he wants."<br>
What he wants.<br>
A sudden thought occurred to me.<br>
"You said there's nothing to eat outside right now, right?"<br>
"I did."<br>
I muttered, looking down at the Murim dumplings in my hand.<br>
"Then what does he eat to live?"<br>
Only I can cook in this world.

853 Episode 46 Big Joke (4)<br>
It was a plan that was carefully planned.<br>
What would I have done if I were Kim Dokja? Or what would I have done if I were Cheon Inho?<br>
No.<br>
I am neither of them, so maybe I could be both.<br>
With such an arrogant thought, I 'imagined' their strategy and created the plan.<br>
The first step of the plan was to bring the 'Transcendent Alliance' to the time fault.<br>
Introduce all the Transcendents that were revived with [Deceased Summoning] into them.<br>
Of course, just infusing the Transcendents into their incarnation bodies wouldn't make them available right away.<br>
Even if the Blood Demon had managed the Transcendents' bodies well, it was impossible for them to fully use their previous life's abilities after being revived.<br>
To make up for that penalty, I started making 'Murim Dumplings'.<br>
[The story fragment, 'Murim Dumpling Recipe', begins its storytelling!]<br>
['Authentic Murim Dumpling' is complete!]<br>
[Your Martial Arts Dumpling completion level is as follows.]<br>
+<br>
Completion level: ★★☆☆☆<br>
Overall: A dumpling with a decent variety. When consumed, 'Skill Proficiency' increases.<br>
+<br>
Right after reaching a certain level of proficiency, the 'Murim Dumpling' I made had different buffs depending on its completion level.<br>
For example, the effect of the low-grade 'Murim Dumpling' is 'Skill Proficiency Increase'.<br>
Even though it is a low-grade product, the increase is quite large, so even if you feed them one, most Transcendents can recover a considerable level of skill.<br>
Of course, there were some who ate several of them.<br>
"Well done, disciple."<br>
They were the leaders, including Cheok Jungyeong.<br>
They could emit dozens of times more power than other Transcendents, and they ate dozens of times more. Especially when Kyrgios ate five dumplings the size of his torso, I couldn’t help but be astonished.<br>
"You’ve got some pretty useful skills."<br>
I don’t know how much memory I used while making dumplings like that.<br>
「"Writer-nim! Hehe, how have you been? It’s nothing else…"」<br>
「"Writer-nim, I’m sorry, but this work…"」<br>
「"Writer-nim ■■■. So here…"」<br>
Most of what I used were the memories of the human 'Lee Hakhyun'. They’re miserable, but they’re the most useless memories in this world. Because they’re useless, they’re paradoxically the most useful memories now.<br>
[You have completed the 'Authentic Martial Arts Dumplings'!]<br>
I thought that if I ate the dumplings I made by trickery, my martial arts dumpling proficiency would go up, but unfortunately, that didn’t happen.<br>
Did they notice that my mind was slowly going crazy every time I made dumplings? The masters who had come back to life often spoke to me.<br>
"Disciple, your eyes are open. And aren't they burst?"<br>
"If you stab, your mind will become clearer. Make dumplings with the same mind as stabbing."<br>
Although their words were not very helpful, I listened to them. I hoped that I might get a clue to transcendence.<br>
"With this body, I might be able to test out the 'False Sword' I'm developing. By the way, what will I cut with the False Sword? Ahem, disciple. Would you like to discuss the 'False Sword' with me?"<br>
"The smallest things are the greatest. But since big and small ultimately depend on the perception of existence, the being that can freely control that cognitive realm can be said to be the greatest."<br>
Honestly, I didn't really understand what they were saying, but I could feel that they were trying to tell me something.<br>
So I listened to them diligently and made dumplings.<br>
Maybe I listened to it too much, since sometimes strange dumplings came out.<br>
[You completed the 'Academic Martial Arts Dumplings'!]<br>
I even tasted the dumplings as a test and collapsed.<br>
Anna Croft said this while wiping my face, which had been suffering from a high fever all night.<br>
"Cheon Inho. You know, but if you complete this operation, you might not be you anymore."<br>
"Of course."<br>
I realized it after making about 100 dumplings. Maybe by the time the story of this fault ends, I'll have forgotten a lot about myself.<br>
But that didn't matter.<br>
"Original humans become no longer themselves over time."<br>
"What do you mean?"<br>
"Memories will disappear even if you stay still."<br>
If memories are going to disappear anyway, wouldn't it be better to use them for something meaningful?<br>
[Congratulations! Your proficiency in 'Murim Dumpling Recipe' has increased!]<br>
[Congratulations! Your proficiency in 'Murim Dumpling Recipe' has increased!]<br>
...<br>
And so, the moment came when I revived my last incarnation with [Deceased Summoning].<br>
Chuk Jungyeong, who was watching the summoning technique from the side, asked.<br>
"Is it over now?"<br>
"Yes. Except for one person."<br>
The last target of [Deceased Summoning] was not the Transcendent Alliance's Transcendent.<br>
Cheok Jungyeong tilted his head and asked.<br>
"Hmm, this is my first time seeing that person?"<br>
She is one of the strongest incarnations I know. I might fail, but I'm going to try.<br>
I looked at her face with my eyes closed, then quietly called her name.<br>
"Heewon-ssi."<br>
What kind of person was Jung Heewon in the 40th round?<br>
Judging from the fact that she was in the Blood Demon's warehouse, she must have been a strong incarnation here too. Maybe she lived here as a 'Mad Butcher'.<br>
Unfortunately, her soul did not respond to [Deceased Summoning].<br>
However, I felt a strange sense of comfort just knowing that she had struggled with all her might in a place I didn't know.<br>
So for the remaining two days, I made dumplings to feed the Transcendents.<br>
[Congratulations! Your proficiency in 'Murim Dumpling Recipe' has increased!]<br>
Luckily, I got a five-star rating. I also succeeded in completing the dumplings.<br>
+<br>
Completion: ★★★★★<br>
Overall: The ultimate martial arts dumplings.<br>
+<br>
I made them while I was in a daze, so I forgot what memories I put into them, but I thought they were okay.<br>
I handed the last dumpling to Anna Croft, who was waiting nearby.<br>
"Give this to Yoo Joonghyuk. He’ll need it."<br>
Anna Croft, who took the dumplings from me, asked.<br>
"People won’t know what you threw away to make these."<br>
"So what if they don’t know?"<br>
"Why did you do this? After all, this world line is just a virtual world line restored by the 'time fault'."<br>
I know that too. This world is just a virtual world line created by the 'Evil Sophist' based on his experiences.<br>
"Because I have to show this story to the King of Fear."<br>
"Why is that important?"<br>
"Because that's how we can prevent the apocalypse."<br>
"Is that all?"<br>
I looked up at the ceiling for a moment.<br>
[The 'King of Fear' is waiting for your story.]<br>
A message that sounded as if it had been waiting.<br>
I spoke as if responding to the message.<br>
"I hope the King of Fear likes this story."<br>
"What does it mean that he likes this story?"<br>
"Ms. Kim Anna. Why do you think the 'Fear Realm' exists?"<br>
"Even my [Future Sight] can't tell me that much."<br>
Why does the 'Fear Realm' exist?<br>
When I first came here, I thought simply.<br>
Since the second Kim Dokja said he likes sad things, he might have a hobby of collecting discarded materials. That's why he created this space to collect things that couldn't be told.<br>
But is that all?<br>
He is also Kim Dokja. Kim Dokja who loves stories the most in this world. Such a Kim Dokja would not be satisfied with simply collecting materials.<br>
"Perhaps everything in this 'Fear Realm' is a dream that the 'King of Fear' is having."<br>
The probability that this 'Fear Realm' is maintained is 'Second Kim Dokja' himself.<br>
In order to maintain this huge layer of imagination, he would have to use the power of the 'Oldest Dream'.<br>
However, he can only dream, but he can't make stories. So someone has to make stories for him.<br>
Perhaps that must be why the 'Recorders of Fear' are gathered here.<br>
They provide reading material for the King of Fear here, and they are receiving something in return.<br>
If so, then so are we.<br>
Even if this 'time fault' is a virtual worldline, if this world is still a dream dreamed by fragments of the 'Oldest Dream'—<br>
"Even if this story is fake, the story we are getting could be real."<br>
"Wait a minute, what is your plan?"<br>
"Yes."<br>
I answered with a grin.<br>
"I will hunt the 'mythical constellations' here."<br>
That was my second operation.<br>
The so-called 'mythical constellation hunting plan'.<br>
"However, no matter how many transcendent constellations you gather, if you fight them head-on, there is no chance of winning."<br>
"I will not fight them head-on."<br>
In order to deal with them, I have to set up a 'stage'. A place where I can become the most powerful, and a stage where they have no choice but to enter voluntarily.<br>
「Let's lure the mythical constellations to Yoo Joonghyuk's 'inner self' to hunt them.」<br>
*<br>
[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint 'Stage 3' is activated!]<br>
[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', is strongly activated!]<br>
In order for this operation to succeed, at least three conditions were necessary.<br>
「One, the myth-grade constellations, including Zeus, must want Yoo Joonghyuk's soul.」<br>
This wasn't difficult.<br>
Because I believed that Yoo Joonghyuk's [Regression] ability and the constellations curious about the secrets of this world would definitely fall into this trap.<br>
「Two, Yoo Joonghyuk must think of me at the right moment.」<br>
Recalling each other is a prerequisite for activating [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint].<br>
Since Yoo Joonghyuk always curses me inwardly, I believed that this condition would be no problem.<br>
Lastly, three.<br>
「The [Fourth Wall] I have to be able to harm the myth-grade constellations.」<br>
In the end, the operation was half successful. Zeus suffered a huge shock that twisted more than 80% of his legends, but he safely escaped the [Fourth Wall].<br>
It may have been because my [Fourth Wall] was weaker than Kim Dokja's, or maybe I underestimated the 'myth-grade constellation' too much.<br>
Since the 'Dream Eater' was caught in this way, I thought it would be worth trying on Zeus too.<br>
Still, there was some gain.<br>
[You have achieved an unbelievable feat.]<br>
[A new legend is sprouting for you!]<br>
If I can just finish this scenario safely, I will be able to obtain the legend of defeating a 'myth-grade constellation'.<br>
"You bastard."<br>
I smiled at Yoo Joonghyuk, who was glaring into the air and growling.<br>
—It's been a while.<br>
"What on earth were you thinking...!"<br>
—Yoo Joonghyuk, it's not over yet.<br>
The [Fourth Wall] surrounding the surroundings dispersed, and at the same time, the snowy landscape began to disappear. Yoo Joonghyuk's consciousness returned to its original place.<br>
The landscape of the ark appeared again in front of me, who had possessed by the guy with [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint].<br>
[The myth-grade constellations of the ark are astonished at seeing you!]<br>
[Some myth-grade constellations are shocked by the 'wall' they witnessed!]<br>
The myth-grade constellations looked somewhat frightened after confirming the [Fourth Wall] I had, but Zeus, whose stories had been considerably damaged, seemed to have rolled his eyes.<br>
[The constellation, 'Lightning', is furious!]<br>
[The constellation, 'Lightning', endures the aftershock of probability and descends into the incarnation!]<br>
The sky of the world line was going wild. The ceiling of the gigantic ark was dyed in various colors, and lightning struck the floor in a continuous stream.<br>
[Many 'mythical constellations' advise the 'lightning constellation' to exercise restraint!]<br>
[Many 'mythical constellations' are curious about the identity of the 'wall'!]<br>
[Some 'mythical constellations' warn that they should not act rashly until they find out the identity of the 'wall'!]<br>
The problem is that Yoo Joonghyuk has not yet come to his senses.<br>
Damn it. If this is going to happen, I have to move Yoo Joonghyuk myself—<br>
[The character in question is refusing your control.]<br>
No, he's refusing the 'first-person protagonist point of view'? I've never heard of such a case before?<br>
Fortunately, Yoo Joonghyuk quickly came to his senses and stood up, holding the Hwangcheonwoelgeuk that had fallen to the floor.<br>
I shouted at Yoo Joonghyuk.<br>
—Dumplings! Let's eat dumplings!<br>
I saw the incarnation of Zeus approaching me from the opposite hallway. The incarnation of a great god made of lightning itself, so much so that just looking at it would make you lose your mind. One fortunate thing is that since he had exhausted his strength in the [Fourth Wall] earlier, the power Zeus can now exert is only this much.<br>
However, even with this power alone, Zeus was showing strength that far surpassed Indra and Kyrgios.<br>
That was the true god of lightning. Zeus, the king of the 12 gods of <Olympus>.<br>
"I'll eat half."<br>
—Eat it all, just like that!<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk didn't listen. As if half a dumpling was enough to deal with Zeus right now.<br>
[Half of the 'Ultimate Murim Dumpling' was consumed.]<br>
A golden current began to surge through Yoo Joonghyuk's entire body.<br>
"The Story Core is beyond the corridor that guy is blocking."<br>
In other words, if he could just get past that Zeus, he could confirm the end of this scenario.<br>
"What's the plan?"<br>
Of course there is a plan. But will we succeed?<br>
I took a deep, invisible breath and said.<br>
—Yoo Joonghyuk.<br>
Even if the content is lacking, I am also Kim Dokja. And of course, even if the number of rounds is lacking, this guy is also Yoo Joonghyuk. Even though we are lacking, we are also Kim Dokja and Yoo Joonghyuk. So there is no way that the main characters of the main story could not do it.<br>
—As you know, I am not good at using my body.<br>
"I know."<br>
—So I will leave your body to you.<br>
"What you are saying is obvious?"<br>
My strategy was simple.<br>
Like Kim Dokja in the main story, I would borrow Yoo Joonghyuk’s power in the text through [Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint].<br>
[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', begins its storytelling.]<br>
[All the stories of the 'Demon King of Salvation' respond to you!]<br>
An unusual spark began to fly from Yoo Joonghyuk’s entire body.<br>
Originally, to use this power, I had to control Yoo Joonghyuk’s body and fight from the 'first-person protagonist point of view'.<br>
But right now, Yoo Joonghyuk is the one controlling the body.<br>
—Become the Yoo Joonghyuk I imagine.<br>
Slowly closing my eyes, the pages began to turn in my head.<br>
"What?"<br>
[I will estimate the number of rounds that can be interpreted based on your reading level.]<br>
Only once did Yoo Joonghyuk appear in the main story using the 'spear'.<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk hesitated as he read my memories together.<br>
"This martial art."<br>
This was the power that Yoo Joonghyuk originally used in the '41st round'.<br>
—That’s right.<br>
Of course, it would have been impossible to overcome the situation with just this martial art.<br>
However, the current Yoo Joonghyuk is the Yoo Joonghyuk who has reached the 'final scenario'.<br>
What would happen if the current Yoo Joonghyuk, who is close to becoming the ultimate incarnation, uses this martial art with the Hwangcheonwolguk?<br>
When I thought of Yoo Joonghyuk in my head, Yoo Joonghyuk stood holding the spear as if he were reproducing my imagination.<br>
「The specialty is the 'spear'.」<br>
As if we were holding a spear together, at that moment, we were embedded in one story. This is the only spear technique that can be compared to [Breaking the Sky Sword] in this universe.<br>
It is the martial art of a world that was destroyed long ago, and the strongest martial art that Yoo Joonghyuk can use now.<br>
「Soul-Killing Spear.」<br>
Zeus came running with a thunderous storm. The great power contained in the spear shook with fierce sparks. The unbearable aftershock was already approaching. Yoo Joonghyuk, holding the spear of the Hwangcheonmoongeuk tightly, opened his mouth.<br>
"You know that too, right?"<br>
At that moment, I thought I knew what Yoo Joonghyuk was going to say.<br>
"You only get one chance."<br>
And damn it.<br>
"Do you know that?"<br>
At this moment, there was only one Kim Dokja who could take those words.<br>
"I'm actually the second."<br>
The spear was fired, and it flew in a single trajectory.<br>

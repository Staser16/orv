861 Episode 47 King of Fear (5)<br>
Stage vs. Stage.<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk was surprised that this tactic was possible.<br>
[The story, 'King Slayer', fumbles around in confusion!]<br>
Is it possible to cover up a 'stage' that has already occurred with another 'stage'?<br>
[The story, 'Demon King of Salvation', continues its storytelling!]<br>
Then the voice in his head—the Demon King of Salvation snickered.<br>
—Actually, it was my first time doing it too. I wasn't sure if it would work or not.<br>
But it worked.<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk could clearly feel the power of 'Staging' rising from his entire body.<br>
「In the gaze of countless stars pouring down from the sky, the story that would kill me was approaching one sentence at a time.」<br>
It was a story from a worldline he didn't know. In that story, Yoo Joonghyuk killed Kim Dokja. To be exact, his colleagues including him killed Kim Dokja.<br>
"Why did this happen?"<br>
—Are you curious?<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk frowned as if he didn’t like it.<br>
What he didn’t like even more was the effect of the 'Ultimate Murim Dumpling'.<br>
In fact, the effect itself was not a problem. It was an effect that literally made the incarnation of the target that was consumed into that of the prime of its prime.<br>
The problem was the period of the 'prime of its prime' defined by the effect.<br>
"Why is my prime in a different worldline?"<br>
The 'Yoo Joonghyuk' in the story was weaker than he is now. He didn’t have the strength to match the constellations, and his proficiency in Breaking the Sky Swordsmanship wasn’t at a high level.<br>
Even so, the 'Ultimate Murim Dumpling' chose his prime as the 'Yoo Joonghyuk' in the tale.<br>
Kim Dokja giggled as he read Yoo Joonghyuk’s mind.<br>
—Well, that’s because it’s the most popular tale, right?<br>
There was no need to ask who. Probably the constellations. And the <Star Stream>. For some reason, the constellations of that worldline liked this story, and thus provided probability.<br>
[The probability of another worldline strengthens your body.]<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk, who was instantly shot out with explosive angular force, thrust his spear. Cheon Inho, surprised by the spear strike of a different path than before, stepped back. With a deafening cracking sound, the blade of 'Unbreakable Faith' shook dangerously. Cheon Inho, who had activated 'Demon King', was pushed back.<br>
The two stories faced each other as the red and white feathers fluttered around like a dance.<br>
[The story, 'King Slayer', continues its storytelling!]<br>
[The story, 'Demon King of Salvation', continues its storytelling!]<br>
It was as if a wolf and a leopard were biting each other. The stories contained in the spear strike and sword strike constantly clashed and growled.<br>
Cheon Inho muttered as if he was impressed.<br>
"I didn't know you'd bring in a 'stage' from another world line. You'd use the fact that I became Kim Dokja like this."<br>
"..."<br>
"Is this the wisdom of the 'Demon King of Salvation' who descended upon you?"<br>
As expected, Cheon Inho seemed to have noticed Kim Dokja's presence.<br>
Cheon Inho added as if warning.<br>
"Demon King of Salvation. This world is the '41st round'. This is not the world line you lived in."<br>
—His tongue is getting longer because it's disadvantageous, that bastard.<br>
"Do you think you can continue to interfere with this worldline like that? There's not much chance left for you now."<br>
—Hey, keep pushing.<br>
"How long do you think this <Star Stream> will tolerate your chaos? Do you want to disappear like this?"<br>
—Ignore it. If we push him to his limit now, we'll win.<br>
With a 'tsutsutsu', a light spark flew from Yoo Joonghyuk's entire body.<br>
[The connection to the exclusive skill 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' is unstable.]<br>
Cheon Inho's point was true. In fact, the [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] used by the first Kim Dokja was infinitely unstable compared to the youngest.<br>
That was inevitable because he was a being inside the [Fourth Wall].<br>
In fact, it was absurd for Kim Dokja inside the [Fourth Wall] to influence the scenario like this.<br>
Nevertheless, the reason why the impossible was possible was because,<br>
[The probability of the 'Fourth Wall' is moving.]<br>
It was because the wishes of the kkoma Kim Dokjas inside the [Fourth Wall] existed.<br>
All 'kkoma Kim Dokjas' are fragments of the 'Oldest Dream' to varying degrees.<br>
So the dream they dream together becomes a kind of powerful probability.<br>
Of course, since they were all quite young, he couldn't tell how long that kind of concentration would last...<br>
—It's okay, so don't worry and fight.<br>
The first Kim Dokja said in a fierce voice.<br>
—As long as that guy doesn’t give up on being 'Kim Dokja', this 'stage' will be valid.<br>
Cheon Inho was an extra who had always dreamed of being the 'main character'. So he could never miss this opportunity to get his hands on the main character’s name.<br>
[The story, 'Demon King of Salvation', roars!]<br>
So from Yoo Joonghyuk’s perspective, now was the crucial opportunity to kill the 'main character'.<br>
[The story, 'King Slayer', is causing a ruckus!]<br>
Story vs. Story. The conflicting stages began to fight each other.<br>
Every time the stories clashed, wounds on Cheon Inho and Yoo Joonghyuk’s bodies increased.<br>
As the situation of no victory continued, Cheon Inho’s narrow eyes narrowed even further.<br>
[The story, 'When All the Stars Close Their Eyes', begins its storytelling!]<br>
In the end, Cheon Inho took out another story. It was Cheon Inho’s main story for the 40th round. 「When All The Stars Close Their Eyes」.<br>
A pitch-black darkness began to fall like snow on the sky. Wherever the darkness fell, the light went out and the scenery collapsed.<br>
Cheon Inho's nickname was 'The One Who Deceived the Stars'.<br>
In the darkness where all the stars' gazes disappeared, he finally became complete.<br>
The moment his vision was consumed by darkness, the blade grazed Yoo Joonghyuk's thigh and waist. Yoo Joonghyuk frowned as he adjusted his grip on his spear.<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk had also suffered a crushing defeat from this story the last time they fought. Fortunately, from that experience, Yoo Joonghyuk knew how to destroy this story.<br>
"Open your eyes. You damn constellations."<br>
Cheon Inho pretended to be surprised at Yoo Joonghyuk's voice.<br>
"Oh, my, did you restore 'that story' through the time fault?"<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk hadn't been just sitting around playing around during the 40th round’s time fault he experienced. Since his resurrection with [Deceased Summoning], Yoo Joonghyuk had been thinking about 'what kind of story' he would bring when he returned to the 41st round.<br>
And now, the story of the 40th round was starting its storytelling once again in Yoo Joonghyuk's body.<br>
[The story, 'King Who Leads the Stars', begins its storytelling.]<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk's story, 'King Who Leads the Stars'. It was a story that burned the probability of the constellations following him and illuminated the darkness of the world.<br>
However, Cheon Inho opened his mouth as if he felt sorry.<br>
"However, that 'story' only has meaning when there are constellations following you."<br>
"…"<br>
"Have you forgotten, Yoo Joonghyuk, this is not the 40th round. There is no constellation following you."<br>
Even the 'Fear Realm' was in an area where the constellations' sight was blocked, and even if there was a constellation that was on his side, there was no way it would be watching this scene right now.<br>
However, Yoo Joonghyuk spoke in a low voice.<br>
"There is one."<br>
At the same time as he said that, light flowed out from somewhere. Surprisingly, the place where the light flowed out was Cheon Inho’s body.<br>
Cheon Inho, startled, looked down at his body and muttered.<br>
"How…"<br>
"That guy is also a constellation."<br>
As if only one light was enough, Yoo Joonghyuk aimed his spear at the light.<br>
"I can see it well now."<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk’s spear, thrown quickly, pierced Cheon Inho’s thigh.<br>
Cheon Inho swung his sword while holding onto his thigh in amazement.<br>
"It’s no use! You can never kill me with such an imperfect 'stage'!"<br>
Sparks rippled in the air once again. The sparks were particularly focused on Yoo Joonghyuk’s 'spear', and the reason was clear.<br>
「And finally, a single sword pierced my heart.」<br>
In the story of the 「Demon King of Salvation」, it was not a 'spear' but a 'sword' that killed Kim Dokja. Cheon Inho, who knew the truth, said mockingly.<br>
"If you had used the sword as I advised, this wouldn't have happened."<br>
"If you're going to criticize the flaws of the stage, then you're the same."<br>
[The story, 'King Slayer', stutters its storytelling.]<br>
Cheon Inho had the body of Cheon Inho, but he was claiming the identity of 'Kim Dokja'.<br>
Because of that, Cheon Inho's 'King Slayer' was also not able to fully display its original status.<br>
"Cheon Inho, do you want to defeat me?"<br>
"Of course."<br>
"There is a way for you to defeat me."<br>
"Oh, I want to hear a trap."<br>
"You just have to give up being Kim Dokja."<br>
"..."<br>
"Why aren't you answering? Didn't you want to defeat me?"<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk thought.<br>
Cheon Inho must have absorbed the soul of 'that guy' in some way and become stronger.<br>
That's how he became 'Kim Dokja'.<br>
Then what if, on the contrary, he could make him vomit out his soul?<br>
"Didn't you say you wanted to be the main character? Is that all you're prepared for?"<br>
"..."<br>
"The 'Evil Sophist' I know wasn't just that kind of person. He set up mean and wicked traps, but he wasn't a coward who hid behind the name of another being. So—"<br>
Yoo Joonghyuk said, swinging his spear lightly to widen the distance.<br>
"The current you isn't even 'Cheon Inho'."<br>
"What do you know?"<br>
A voice that gnashed his teeth.<br>
Cheon Inho's swordsmanship was filled with anger.<br>
"You, who were born as the main character of a story from the beginning, you who endured life with a noble and sublime purpose, what do you know about those who were not chosen?"<br>
"I don't know. I don't want to know."<br>
Every time a light burst out in the darkness, a story flowed from the two of them. Amidst the resonating sounds of panting, the two swung their spears and swords at each other.<br>
Without any understanding of each other, they simply used their weapons with the purpose of killing each other.<br>
Cheon Inho laughed.<br>
"In the end, I will win."<br>
It was a laugh that seemed to indicate that his goal had been achieved simply by continuing this fight.<br>
"How long do you think the Demon King of Salvation can help you?"<br>
The power of 『Staging』 embedded in Yoo Joonghyuk's entire body was gradually diminishing.<br>
"The protagonist of this world line has now changed. The story that the constellations want to see has naturally changed as well. That story cannot protect you forever."<br>
"..."<br>
"Yoo Joonghyuk, be my comrade now. Then I will show you the end of this world."<br>
That was when the 'King of Fear' reacted.<br>
A large earthquake occurred throughout the 'Big House'. In the uneasy vision, the Outer Gods of the Fear Realm cried out once again. And then something began.<br>
[The 'King of Fear' reacts strongly to the story in front of him!]<br>
Thunder rumbled in the sky and a huge crack appeared. At the same time, a being appeared through the crack. He was a dokkaebi special agent dispatched to the 'Fear Realm' on behalf of the 'Management Bureau'.<br>
[Wow, what is this—]<br>
It was Bihyung. Bihyung looked back at Cheon Inho and Yoo Joonghyuk as if he was urgently trying to figure out the situation, and soon understood his mission.<br>
[Constellations, opening an emergency temporary channel!]<br>
Temporary. As soon as the channel was opened, starlight began to rush in through the cracks.<br>
[Many constellations have confirmed the 'Fear Realm'!]<br>
[Nebula, <Eden>, checks the inside of the 'Fear Realm'!]<br>
[Nebula, <Asgard>, checks the inside of the 'Fear Realm'!]<br>
[Nebula, <Olympus>, checks the inside of the 'Fear Realm'!]<br>
…<br>
As the inside of the 'Fear Realm' hidden behind a veil was revealed, the 'Big House' was filled with scattered starlight.<br>
[The constellations of the giant nebulae are shocked!]<br>
[The 'King of Fear' manifests his power.]<br>
[No constellation can use 'indirect messages' on the channel in this area.]<br>
As if he would not tolerate interrupting this story, the sky was covered in silence.<br>
As countless constellations twinkled silently, Cheon Inho and Yoo Joonghyuk aimed their spears and swords at each other.<br>
With a sound of tsutsutsutsu, the story that had been protecting Yoo Joonghyuk finally disappeared.<br>
[The story, 'Demon King of Salvation', ends its storytelling.]<br>
With that, Cheon Inho looked as if he was anticipating his victory.<br>
"It's over now, Yoo Joonghyuk."<br>
But the next moment, a star in the sky blinked.<br>
It was a constellation from <Eden>.<br>
[The story, 'Demon King of Salvation', stutters its storytelling.]<br>
Then another star twinkled. This time, it was a star from <Emperor>.<br>
[The story, 'Demon King of Salvation', took its breath away.]<br>
Again, another starlight twinkled. It was starlight flowing from the small and medium-sized nebulae of the 'absolute evil' lineage.<br>
[The story, 'Demon King of Salvation', continues its storytelling.]<br>
The story began to tell another story, emitting even brighter light than before.<br>
Cheon Inho stared at the sky with his eyes wide open in disbelief.<br>
There was no way.<br>
The story that Yoo Joonghyuk was currently holding was not from this worldline. It was not a story that the constellations of this worldline enjoyed with joy or sorrow.<br>
"No way—"<br>
Nevertheless, the story continued.<br>
That meant that there were constellations that wanted that story.<br>
That meant that there were constellations that wanted to reveal that story even if it meant burning themselves.<br>
[The story, 'Demon King of Salvation', stares at the distant sky.]<br>
Therefore, the story continues once again.<br>
To prove that there are still constellations in this universe that like this story.

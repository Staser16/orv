872 Episode 47 King of Fear (16)<br>
How long did the King of Fear have to endure for this moment?<br>
It was a terrible, beautiful, natural, and mysterious dream. A nightmare that finally announced the end of a world. An endless darkness that no starlight dared to reveal its origin.<br>
In that darkness, the last tail moved.<br>
【Kim Dokja!】<br>
Jang Hayoung, who had come through the doorway late, screamed. However, her voice was buried in the story of the giant tale and could not be heard.<br>
The King of Fear's finger fell from above, and the tail of the last dragon sank in response.<br>
[The giant tale, 'Season of Light and Darkness', is recreated!]<br>
The last tail fluttered with a loud noise. The first shock wave passed through the doorway of the Time Fault.<br>
I watched the scene through [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] Stage 0. The time that the King of Fear had endured to dream this dream passed through my soul.<br>
[The story, 'King of Fear', begins its storytelling.]<br>
At that moment, I was the King of Fear, and the King of Fear was me.<br>
Kim Dokja, who had dreamed for a long time in a 'Big House' that was so small compared to the world he had dreamed of.<br>
「"Hayoung-ah."」<br>
And there was a fighter who had been by his side.<br>
「"Will I be able to have a happy dream someday?"」<br>
Even he, who loved sadness more than anyone else, actually wanted to have a happy dream.<br>
But he did not know what a 'happy dream' was. He had forgotten what it was, and perhaps had not learned it.<br>
Jang Hayoung said to him.<br>
「"Dreaming a happy dream is not important."」<br>
Stroking the head of the boy who had now forgotten what happiness meant, Jang Hayoung told him an old story.<br>
「"The important thing is to be alive now."」<br>
Jang Hayoung also did not know what happiness was.<br>
However, she had long-scribbled sentences on the wall.<br>
Precious sentences that she had written down one by one on the unidentified wall—the 「Wall of Impossible Communication」—hoping that someone would read them again someday.<br>
She was reading those sentences again after a long time. She was reading the sentences that she had hoped someone would read.<br>
Helping Eileen at the clock shop Etica ("Actually, I don’t know much about clocks.").<br>
The taste of the 'Devil’s Stir-fried Tripe of the Ruined Lodge' made by Chef Marc ("You’ll regret not eating it if you only look at its appearance.").<br>
The day she first encountered Kim Dokja in the world of terrible scenarios ("Some bastard threw a shoulder punch at me…").<br>
The moment when time began to flow again in the Demon World that had stopped ("It was so frustrating.").<br>
The memory of her, who had been pessimistic about her talents her whole life, blossoming for the first time and becoming Kim Dokja’s 'fighter'. ("It was so overwhelming at that time.").<br>
The time when people who were not given any roles in the scenario could all become 'Kim Dokja' at the same time, shouting 'revolution'. ("I will probably never forget it.").<br>
Jang Hayoung talked about all those things as if they were troubled, sad, or happy.<br>
Kim Dokja listened to the story silently, nodded, and asked.<br>
「"Is that happiness?"」<br>
Jang Hayoung was silent for a moment, then smiled faintly and answered.<br>
「"I don't know."」<br>
「"Why are you telling me that?"」<br>
「"I want you to live."」<br>
The moment the story took a deep breath, he disappeared.<br>
[The story, 'King of Fear', ends its storytelling.]<br>
The King of Fear spoke to Jang Hayoung, the fighter who was shouting from afar.<br>
【I'm sorry. I couldn't keep my promise until the end.】<br>
The shock wave of the tail wagging, approaching and crushing the entire upper part of the 'Time Rift Room'. According to the main story, the 'first tail strike' of the 'Final Dragon' destroyed a quarter of the <Star Stream>.<br>
The tail strike consisted of a total of three shock waves, and the 'shock wave' approaching now was the 'first shock wave'.<br>
At that moment, Zeus's Astraphe aimed at the sky. The <Olympus> fleet, which had finished lining up its troops, was waiting for orders.<br>
[Fire.]<br>
Dozens of ships simultaneously fired their flash cannons.<br>
A magical cannon containing the great legend of <Olympus>.<br>
The great power contained in each shot swept away the nearby Outer Gods and collided with the shock wave of the 'Final Dragon'.<br>
Kukukukukukukuku!<br>
However, despite that relentless barrage, the shock wave did not take any damage at all.<br>
The end was approaching slowly and steadily.<br>
The faces of the Twelve Gods who confirmed the wave darkened.<br>
[How could that be…!]<br>
That was the power of the 'Final Dragon'. It was the disaster of the <Star Stream> that ended the 'Great Battle of the Holy Demon'.<br>
Even so, there was a way to stop that tail slap.<br>
Kim Dokja in the main story blocked that shockwave.<br>
「The first shockwave of the tail slap is made up of 'lightning'.」<br>
Considering the lineup of constellations that had withstood the shockwave in the main story, Zeus, a myth-grade constellation that controlled 'lightning', was qualified to block that first shockwave.<br>
Even so, Zeus's judgment was as follows.<br>
[Withdraw.]<br>
A portal opened in the air and the ships began to move backward.<br>
In that brief moment, Zeus made his judgment.<br>
Even if he could offset the 'first shockwave', it would be difficult to fully handle the power of the Final Dragon here.<br>
Even if he could handle it, he probably thought it would be more harmful than beneficial.<br>
It was a cowardly but wise choice.<br>
Because.<br>
Tsutsutsutsutsut!<br>
Immediately after the tail wagging began, everything in the Fear Realm began to be swept away by the aftermath of probability.<br>
【Ahahahahah!】<br>
A space that is not strange even if its existence is broken at any time.<br>
If it were a normal constellation, they wouldn't want to stay in this area for a minute or a second.<br>
[The 'Fragments of the Oldest Dream' to be pushed.]<br>
Zeus, who was hiding behind the portal, looked back at this side for the last time.<br>
[<Olympus> will definitely take back our ■■.]<br>
At the end of these words, the presence of Zeus and the 12 gods completely disappeared.<br>
[The giant nebula, <Olympus>, suffered a huge blow and leaves the 'Fear Realm'.]<br>
I had a bitter smile in my heart.<br>
After making things like this, they're going to run away.<br>
Still, with this, <Olympus>’s giant story would have been hit hard.<br>
No matter how much the 'scale of probability' was broken, the power that Zeus used in the 'Fear Realm' was the power that was suitable for the final chapter of the scenarios.<br>
Maybe this time they should step down from the 3 Great Nebulae.<br>
By the way, what will happen to us if this happens?<br>
<Olympus> disappeared, but the shock wave left by the 'first tail slap' was still hitting us.<br>
【Ooooooooooo!】<br>
The terrified Outer Gods were each running away to different 'Time Faults'.<br>
I thought it would be a good idea to call Jaehwan again, but as Jang Hayoung said, there was no way to call him now.<br>
It meant that from now on, we had to block that shock wave with our own strength.<br>
In the main story, there were four constellations that blocked that 'tail slap'.<br>
Thor and Dionysus, Kim Dokja who activated [Electrification], and Kyrgios. Only after they joined forces did they manage to block the 'first shockwave'.<br>
However, there was no Thor or Dionysus here.<br>
What was here was...<br>
[Seeing that guy finally woke up, it seems my disciple failed.]<br>
When I looked back, I saw that Cheok Jungyeong was looking this way with his eyes wide open. Fortunately, the leaders of the 'Transcendence Alliance' seemed to have survived.<br>
[But it's too early to give up.]<br>
Kyrgios, who escaped from the big house, activated [Incarnation] and rose into the sky while emitting a transcendental energy.<br>
[There is a 'paradox' here.']<br>
With a 'Kudduk' sound, the white-blue lightning he emitted began to offset the shockwave.<br>
Kugugugugu.<br>
But it was too much for him alone. Even though he was one of the leaders of the 'Transcendence Alliance', if only one Transcendence could block the 'first shockwave', the last dragon wouldn't have been called a disaster.<br>
Fortunately, he wasn't alone.<br>
【Eeeeeeeeeeeeeee】<br>
The king of Transcendents, Jang Hayoung, who activated [Electrification], rushed towards the burning Kyrgios.<br>
Following them, unknown Outer Gods joined them.<br>
【Ooooooooooo!】<br>
Is this an illusion?<br>
At first glance, the backs of the Outer Gods fighting the dragons looked exactly like Thor and Dionysus.<br>
As expected, Jang Hayeong, whose entire body began to burn black, turned around and shouted.<br>
【Kim Dokja! Close the door! Quickly!】<br>
A thought suddenly occurred to me after hearing those words.<br>
The reason why the tail of 'Choi Huryong' had covered the Fear Realm was because the 'King of Fear' had opened the door to the 'Time Fault'. Then, on the contrary, if only the King of Fear could close that door once more—<br>
「The King of Fear cannot close the 'door'.」<br>
[Exclusive skill, 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' stage 0 is released.]<br>
[Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint] was released, and the King of Fear sneezed violently into the air. I came out of his mouth with sticky mucus.<br>
【Youngest.】<br>
I opened my eyes in my incarnation body with a slight dizziness. The dazzlingly burning King of Fear was before my eyes.<br>
I knew why he was calling me.<br>
He was Kim Dokja, who only had the most horrible dreams. In order to summon 'Choi Huryong', he had just squandered all the probability he had.<br>
【I cannot close that 'door'.】<br>
He cannot stop his nightmare.<br>
[The train will come soon, and I will put you and the children on that train. So that you can evacuate far away from this 'Fear Realm'.]<br>
Even until the very last moment, he was worried about others, not himself.<br>
"Are you giving up like this? We've come this far. We can do it! It's a disaster you've called, so you can get rid of it. So—"<br>
The King of Fear shook his head as if dismissing my words.<br>
【Even though I've been dreaming for so long, the only dreams I can have are nightmares.】<br>
"But."<br>
【Maybe except for one dream.】<br>
The King of Fear, who had lightly glanced at the entirety of the Fear Realm, looked back at me for the last time.<br>
It was a truly suffocating gaze. I stumbled, unable to bear that gaze.<br>
【Perhaps this moment.】<br>
When I first met the 'King of Fear', I thought he was a little scary. But damn it, at this moment, I thought his appearance was beautiful.<br>
I thought that his appearance, risking everything to protect everyone else, was more like Kim Dokja than any other Kim Dokja I knew.<br>
【This is probably why I've been dreaming all this time.】<br>
A horn sounded from afar. A familiar train running on the tracks.<br>
The sound of wheels.<br>
A subway was approaching from afar.<br>
「Subway on the way home from work」.<br>
The train that brought us into this terrible scenario world.<br>
【Thank you for giving me a good dream, youngest.】<br>
And yet, that train was the only salvation that could save us from hell at this moment.<br>
"Let's go together."<br>
I said, holding his hand tightly. Then, the King of Fear shook his head.<br>
【That can't be. I am the 'Fear Realm' itself.】<br>
"If you die here, all the dreams you've collected will disappear, right?"<br>
【...】<br>
"There is one way."<br>
I finished speaking, looking back and forth between the shockwave that was now right in front of me and the train rushing toward me from afar.<br>
"There is a way to avoid the 'end' without any of this Fear Realm disappearing."

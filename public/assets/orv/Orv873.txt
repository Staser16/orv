873 Episode 47 King of Fear (17)<br>
【A way to avoid the 'end' without any fear disappearing.】<br>
The King of Fear smiled bitterly as if pointing out the unreality of my words.<br>
【You're also a helpless Kim Dokja.】<br>
In fact, I think it would have been the same for any Kim Dokja, not just me.<br>
If any Kim Dokja knew what the King of Fear was thinking, any Kim Dokja would have made the same choice as me.<br>
A spark of probability flew out of the air again. The train running from afar was caught in the net of probability and couldn't come over.<br>
Perhaps the <Star Stream> was blocking the train.<br>
The train was forcing the probability of the end so that the 'King of Fear' couldn't get on board and so that he couldn't escape this world.<br>
One fortunate thing is that the probability doesn't apply to anyone else except him. Due to the strong aftershock, the tail of the 'Final Dragon' also slowed down significantly.<br>
Now was the perfect time to escape the Fear Realm.<br>
【Everyone, get on the train! Hurry up!】<br>
As Jang Hayoung, who was enduring the tail of the Final Dragon on the front line, shouted, the Outer Gods and the transcendents who couldn't escape through the 'Time Fault' began to board the train one by one.<br>
Watching the residents of the Fear Realm hurriedly evacuating, the King of Fear opened his mouth.<br>
【I can't get on that, but you and your friends are different. You can get on that and escape even now.】<br>
"I won't get on it."<br>
The King of Fear looked at me blankly and then asked.<br>
【Do you know what that means?】<br>
"I know."<br>
There is only one way to end this apocalypse without anything in this Fear Realm disappearing.<br>
"We’ll become one Kim Dokja."<br>
I will take over his story and close the door of the 'Time Fault' that Choi Huryong is trying to cross.<br>
【You might fail. You might just die a dog's death.】<br>
"No, I can do it."<br>
It might not be possible alone, but it can be done with two. If we combine the power of the 'Kim Dokja fragments' that the two of us possess, if we combine our imaginations that even <Olympus> coveted, it will definitely be possible.<br>
And above all.<br>
"I also dream well."<br>
I can't be sure whether the dream we create is the dream that the 'King of Fear' wanted.<br>
But at least it will be a fun dream.<br>
[The constellation, 'Goryeo’s Swordsmaster', is watching your choice.]<br>
[The constellation, 'Maritime War God', is watching your choice.]<br>
[The constellation, 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon', is watching your choice.]<br>
…<br>
The dream that the stars in the sky that are still watching this story like.<br>
[The constellation, 'Father of the Rich Night', is watching your choice.]<br>
The father of the 'Underworld', who had not appeared until now, was also looking into the Fear Realm. Maybe he had heard news of <Olympus> and came to visit.<br>
Either way, it would not be bad for them to see this story. The more constellations see this stage, the bigger the scale of the 'great tale' we would obtain if we completed this stage.<br>
The King of Fear, who was looking up at the constellations in the sky with me, said.<br>
【I thought dreams were always dreamed alone.】<br>
The King of Fear, who reached out to me, was already on the verge of falling apart. The second Kim Dokja, grabbed my hand tightly with his weak hand.<br>
I felt his story flowing into the hand I was holding. It was a story that encompassed the entirety of the 'Fear Realm'.<br>
【No matter what kind of dream it is, this is our farewell, youngest.】<br>
The moment I saw his weak expression, an intense hunger boiled inside me. When you become 'one Kim Dokja', one Kim Dokja is absorbed by the other Kim Dokja.<br>
[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', mocks your will.]<br>
[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', opens his mouth as if he had been waiting!]<br>
I calmed down the story with firm patience and said.<br>
"What are you talking about?"<br>
It was certainly as he said. Normally, two fragments should be combined to become 'one Kim Dokja'.<br>
But there was something he still didn't know.<br>
"You still don't know what a happy dream is."<br>
[Exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', activates!]<br>
Instead of absorbing the story of the 'King of Fear', I started to let his story flow through the [Fourth Wall].<br>
[Exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', is recording the story.]<br>
[Trait, 'Record Repairer', is activated!]<br>
[Your lost records are starting to be repaired.]<br>
The 'King of Fear', who realized what I was doing, opened his eyes wide.<br>
I smiled at him and added.<br>
"At least until you find out—"<br>
The story flowed through my blood vessels like an electric current. For a moment, my consciousness became dizzy and then returned.<br>
"You should stay with me until we find out what our 'happiness' is."<br>
The situation was definitely different from the 'first Kim Dokja'.<br>
The story I had to copy to the [Fourth Wall] now was no different than this entire 'Fear Realm'.<br>
[The aftershock of probability is coming!]<br>
I saw Jang Hayoung, who noticed our change, shouting in my direction from afar.<br>
But no one, including Jang Hayoung, could approach me. The net of probability that wrapped us tightly did not allow it.<br>
As if the current was getting faster, the story of the Fear Realm began to be conveyed to me at an increasingly faster rate.<br>
「The beginning and end of a world were there.」<br>
The Nameless  that had visited the Fear Realm and the memories of the Outer Gods. The voices of the transcendental gods. The constellations' contempt all flowed into me.<br>
And deep within that tale was the words of a great being.<br>
「【Are you the 'King of Fear'?】」<br>
Judging from the level felt in the true words, it was the voice of an Outer God that may be equivalent to the 'end of the word'.<br>
「【If you thought you could lock us up in such a flimsy 'house', you were mistaken.】」<br>
Even as my consciousness became hazy, I tried not to miss the words of the stories that I was hearing.<br>
「【Your efforts are admirable, so I will wait a little longer.】」<br>
「【Remember, baby.】」<br>
「【You can’t stop the apocalypse just because you’re blocking us.】」<br>
I couldn’t even guess which Outer Gods were giving advice.<br>
I wonder if there’s something the 'King of Fear' hasn’t told me about the 'Fear Realm'.<br>
「【Remember. You were the ones who stole our 'story' first.】」<br>
I felt something inside me slowly expanding like a dam overflowing. I was starting to feel suffocated, and my breathing was starting to become difficult.<br>
[Exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', warns you!]<br>
In the end, even the [Fourth Wall] had reached its limit.<br>
I thought that maybe this might happen, but it happened too quickly.<br>
Unlike the [Fourth Wall] that Kim Dokja had, the [Fourth Wall] that I had was still incomplete.<br>
【Youngest.】<br>
My library was too small to copy the stories of the King of Fear without any damage.<br>
【Let go.】<br>
I didn’t let go.<br>
If I hold on a little longer, I can know your truth. I can know what you’re hiding. Maybe I can understand you. And so,<br>
「I can save you.」<br>
But the next moment, my consciousness became hazy as if something in my head was cut off.<br>
【Youngest.】<br>
In my fading consciousness, I heard the urgent voice of the second son Kim Dokja calling me. A voice that sounded distant, as if he was deep in thought.<br>
【…!】<br>
In the raging sparks, our two incarnation bodies were slowly disappearing.<br>
And then, a small portal appeared behind the 'King of Fear'.<br>
What appeared in the portal was a pure white hand.<br>
Knowing what it was, I tried to tell the 'King of Fear' to avoid it.<br>
You shouldn’t be caught by that hand. Then you too will disappear like the other 'kkoma Kim Dokjas'.<br>
The moment the hand that moved quickly grabbed the 'King of Fear's' nape, the King of Fear looked back. When on earth did he notice? The King of Fear was holding the white hand with the other hand that was holding my hand.<br>
【I'm sorry, but I can't give it to you.】<br>
It was as if he knew the identity of the 'white hand.'<br>
—Dreams are meant to be dreamed alone. So let's go to a place where you can dream alone. With me.<br>
【No.】<br>
—Why did you change your mind now?<br>
【I don't know.】<br>
The King of Fear stared at me silently and then added.<br>
【If you don't know that, it'll be hard for you to collect all the 'Kim Dokja fragments' forever.】<br>
The white hand that stopped at those words let out a mischievous laugh and said.<br>
—That's why I hate 'Kim Dokja.'<br>
A blinding white light burst out, and the King of Fear's painful groan could be heard. The sparks surrounding the surroundings gradually decreased.<br>
As soon as my consciousness returned, I opened my mouth.<br>
"King of Fear."<br>
I did not hear an answer.<br>
"Kim Dokja!"<br>
His hand that was holding mine was nowhere to be seen.<br>
[Exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', stops recording.]<br>
[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', is licking his lips.]<br>
I couldn't figure out what was happening.<br>
I briefly lost consciousness, a white hand appeared, and the white hand and the 'King of Fear' talked.<br>
And when I came to my senses, the 'King of Fear' was gone.<br>
[You have achieved the impossible feat!]<br>
[The Great Dokkaebi of the Management Bureau is watching your presence!]<br>
[Your  ' evolves once again!]<br>
[Your Tale holds the possibility of a 'Giant '!]<br>
[The probability of the <Star Stream> begins to move!]<br>
I couldn't be happy about the messages that came one after another.<br>
A train horn was heard from afar. The train carrying the Outer Gods and the Transcendents was finally ready to leave.<br>
【Kim Dokja! Run away quickly! I can't hold out any longer—】<br>
Jang Hayoung, who was still blocking the last tail wagging at the front line, shouted at me.<br>
But I couldn't move.<br>
If the Great King of Fear had disappeared like this, or if he had been kidnapped by the 'White Hand'—that is, by Asmodeus...<br>
Woow.<br>
That was when I felt a vibration in my arms. My phone was ringing in my pocket. I answered the phone without hesitation.<br>
—You crazy bastard!<br>
It was the voice of the first Kim Dokja, the 'Demon King of Salvation'.<br>
"What happened?"<br>
—What happened! Do you know what happened to this place because of you?<br>
"You all watched. What happened to the King of Fear!"<br>
The Demon King of Salvation closed his mouth at my urgent voice. After a moment of ominous silence, the Demon King of Salvation let out a deep sigh.<br>
He said.<br>
—The second one came in safely.<br>
I also let out a sigh of relief.<br>
—But there must have been some damage to the story on the way in, because he’s still unconscious…<br>
"Story loss?"<br>
—Anyway, he came in safely. No, more than that, do you know what you did? Right now…!<br>
"Please help me."<br>
—Huh?<br>
What happened inside [Fourth Wall] was an important issue, but what was more important was the incident unfolding before our eyes. The aftermath of probability was dying down, and Choi Huryong’s shockwave was now reaching us.<br>
—Can’t you just get on the train and run away?<br>
"If I run away, what about that person?"<br>
I looked up at the being who was still blocking the shockwave in front of me.<br>
Kim Dokja’s fighter.<br>
The being who swore to protect Kim Dokja’s side no matter what happened.<br>
"Jang Hayoung will die."<br>
Jang Hayoung never got on the train. Maybe she had decided that this place was her ■■.<br>
Even if she had blocked the first shockwave, Choi Huryong's shockwave was three stages in total.<br>
"We have to close the door. Is there no other way?"<br>
At first, I tried to control the time fault of the 'Fear Realm' by borrowing the power of the 'King of Fear'.<br>
However, I couldn't properly exercise any power on the Fear Realm because I had not properly absorbed him but had put him in the [Fourth Wall], or because he was unconscious.<br>
In other words, if this continued, I would inevitably be hit by Choi Huryong's tail and go to the underworld.<br>
—Well, if you insist on closing it, there's nothing you can't do.<br>
"How?"<br>
—You spoke confidently to the second, but didn't you have another plan?<br>
"My plan is you."<br>
I said with a grin.<br>
"Please tell me quickly. Otherwise, you might get killed if I keep charging forward like this."<br>
The Demon King of Salvation clicked his tongue and replied, seemingly taken aback by my threat to his life.<br>
—Or so it is.<br>
"Yes?"<br>
—Just charge forward. Close the door when you get close to it.<br>
"Then I’ll get killed?"<br>
How could I approach the door when even the constellations of the highest rank were destroyed by the shockwave?<br>
Then the 'Demon King of Salvation' replied.<br>
—You should be fine now. Ah, it’s all done.<br>
Then a message came.<br>
[The effect of the characteristic, 'Record Repairer', is activated!]<br>
[Record repair completed!]<br>
[Exclusive skill, '□□', restoration completed.]<br>
…<br>
[You have become the new 'Recorder of Fear'.]

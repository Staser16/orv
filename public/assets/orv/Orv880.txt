880 Episode 48 Avatar (3)<br>
"No, wait a minute."<br>
It was unfair. Because it wasn’t me who left Han Sooyoung alone for the 1,863rd round.<br>
"I’m not an [Avatar]."<br>
"Then what?"<br>
"I—"<br>
I hesitated. I couldn’t think of anything I could say to persuade her.<br>
For a moment, a brief temptation occurred to me.<br>
What if I just used [Incite]? If I used [Incite] to persuade Han Sooyoung to do my bidding.<br>
"I can hear your head spinning."<br>
The moment I heard Han Sooyoung’s laughter, I realized. The opponent in front of me wasn’t someone who could do that.<br>
There was nothing I could do. From here on out, I had no choice but to play fair.<br>
"Just as you’re not the avatar of 'Han Sooyoung in the 3rd round', I’m not just Kim Dokja’s avatar."<br>
Han Sooyoung smiled as if she found it interesting.<br>
"Really? How much of your memories did you inherit?"<br>
"I barely received any memories."<br>
"Yeah. They call someone like you [Avatar]. But isn't that right?"<br>
"Does the amount of memories you have matter? It's not the amount of memories that proves who I am."<br>
"Is that so?"<br>
Han Sooyoung nodded and wrote something in her notebook.<br>
I added while looking at Han Sooyoung like that.<br>
"Just because Han Sooyoung did something wrong in the third round, you wouldn't blame her for it. It's a bit unfair to blame me for Kim Dokja's mistakes."<br>
"Are you trying to say that you're not that Kim Dokja?"<br>
"Yes. I'm not the Kim Dokja you know."<br>
"Then there's no reason for me to help you? Because you're not that Kim Dokja."<br>
Is that really the case? Damn it. I quickly changed my subject.<br>
"But there's something called joint responsibility in this world. Since I'm also using Kim Dokja's name, I think I'm qualified to atone for his mistakes."<br>
Kim Dokja's joint responsibility.<br>
It feels a bit unfair. If there is a responsibility for the Kim Dokja Solidarity, shouldn’t there also be benefits for the Kim Dokja Solidarity? But I’ve never received anything like that.<br>
Of course, I couldn’t complain to Han Sooyoung right in front of me.<br>
Han Sooyoung stared at me blankly and chuckled.<br>
"How are you going to atone for this?"<br>
I cleared my throat slightly and began to speak.<br>
"It’s all my fault. I’m sorry for leaving you alone. But I didn’t do it on purpose either."<br>
Han Sooyoung’s eyes shook subtly. I didn’t miss that moment and continued to speak.<br>
"I was curious about your story too. I was curious about how you were doing, what you were thinking, and if something big had happened in your world."<br>
"…"<br>
"I didn’t intentionally avoid visiting. I was just scared."<br>
"Are you scared?"<br>
"Sometimes, when it’s a story you really like, it’s scary to know the ending."<br>
Han Sooyoung quietly watched me like that, then glanced at Lee Seolhwa who was peeking at her from behind and smiled bitterly.<br>
"If someone saw me, they'd think I was doing this because I wanted an apology."<br>
"You weren't?"<br>
"What would I do accepting something like that?"<br>
"Then why are you upset?"<br>
Was that too direct? Han Sooyoung's expression cracked for a moment.<br>
I didn't miss the opportunity and asked.<br>
"Do you by any chance like Kim Dokja?"<br>
"What?"<br>
"If that's not the case, there's no reason for you to be so upset. Weren't you and Kim Dokja just in a business relationship? You gave and took. You broke up cleanly."<br>
"…"<br>
"Or did you actually want to go back to the third round with Kim Dokja?"<br>
Han Sooyoung belatedly asked with narrowed eyes.<br>
"You're talking about having a pierced mouth, but have you forgotten who's holding the knife?"<br>
"I know. You’re holding on to it. And very tightly. So please spare me."<br>
"Oh my."<br>
"If you spare me, I’ll help you meet Kim Dokja."<br>
Han Sooyoung paused for a moment and asked back.<br>
"Why do you think I want to meet that kid?"<br>
"If not, I’m sorry, but that kid would really want to see you."<br>
Han Sooyoung’s expression once again showed embarrassment.<br>
"If you keep talking nonsense…"<br>
"Han Sooyoung."<br>
Tsk tsk, sparks colored my incarnation body along with the sound. I decided to settle the matter before the aftermath grew any bigger.<br>
"Kim Dokja is in danger. Only you can save him."<br>
Kim Dokja is in danger. I clearly saw the blue that spread across Han Sooyoung’s expression at those words. I was a little envious, and a little sorry.<br>
"Can you take responsibility for that statement?"<br>
"Yes, I can take responsibility."<br>
I knew how cowardly my words were.<br>
Even if I didn’t do anything, she would meet Kim Dokja again. More precisely, the less I did anything, the higher the probability that she would meet Kim Dokja again.<br>
She was destined to become tIs123, and she would definitely meet the young Kim Dokja.<br>
Of course, it wouldn’t be the kind of reunion she wanted.<br>
"How is Kim Dokja in danger?"<br>
"That is…"<br>
"If I save you, you will tell me?"<br>
When I nodded, Han Sooyoung glared at me with a disapproving look and asked.<br>
"I need to know who you made a contract with to come here."<br>
"Will you help me?"<br>
"I will listen to your story."<br>
Fortunately, the atmosphere was not bad. I swallowed a light sigh and said.<br>
"I didn’t make a contract with anyone."<br>
"What?"<br>
"I didn’t make an 'Otherworldly Covenant' to come here."<br>
There is a possibility that an 'Otherworldly Covenant' that I don't know about has been activated.<br>
Strictly speaking, I came here through the 'Fear Realm', and the owner of the 'Fear Realm' was the 'King of Fear'.<br>
The 'King of Fear' held numerous otherworldly deities, so it would be safe to say that the 'Fear Realm' itself was an 'Otherworldly Covenant'.<br>
However, the 'Fear Realm' has now been destroyed, and the 'King of Fear' has lost his power.<br>
In other words, the 'contract' that sent me here has lost its effect. However, Han Sooyoung's expression upon hearing my words was strange.<br>
"Wait a minute, then you—"<br>
At that moment, thunder rang out from outside the window. Han Sooyoung's eyebrows furrowed and Lee Seolhwa opened the curtains by the window almost at the same time.<br>
"Captain, something is strange!"<br>
Lee Hyunsung's shout from outside. There was a huge portal swirling in the sky outside the window.<br>
I and Han Sooyoung knew what it was.<br>
「Great Hall.」<br>
A passageway to another world was about to open in the vast expanse of sky. A tremendous feast could be felt beyond the hall.<br>
Han Sooyoung glared at me with a frown.<br>
"What on earth have you done?"<br>
I looked up at the sky in confusion.<br>
「Even if it was the 1,863rd round, there’s no way a 'god of another world' would suddenly descend in the clear sky.」<br>
The scale of probability eventually shifted toward offsetting its weight.<br>
If a god of another world had appeared, it meant that there was a 'probability' that he would descend in this world line.<br>
My heart sank.<br>
「It’s because of me.」<br>
Up until now, my existence had been protected by a 'scenario'.<br>
[The Management Bureau does not accept your existence.]<br>
However, there was no scenario assigned to me in this worldline. In other words, the current me was an existence that was not needed in the 'scenario'.<br>
Tsutsutsutsut!<br>
The spark that was immediately felt in my incarnation body was the proof.<br>
This worldline does not consider my existence 'probable'. Therefore, in order to protect the probability of this world, my existence must disappear.<br>
【Ooooooooooo.】<br>
Therefore, the guy coming over from the 'Great Hall' right now was a kind of grim reaper that came to erase me from this world.<br>
【IwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantitIwantit.】<br>
Han Sooyoung didn't panic and just flicked her fingers in the air.<br>
['True Word Defense System' is activating!]<br>
I felt something like a transparent membrane surrounding the headquarters. Surprisingly, the defense barrier was withstanding the true words of that distant outer god.<br>
Kugugugugu.<br>
But as the size of the 'Great Hall' growing in the sky grew, the shaking of the defense barrier also increased.<br>
Han Sooyoung glared at me and asked.<br>
"Do you know what you did?"<br>
"I'm sorry."<br>
"You're apologizing for bringing something like that? Lee Seolhwa, did you finish measuring its level?"<br>
Lee Seolhwa, who was waiting nearby, shook her head and answered.<br>
"The story measuring device is broken."<br>
"It was fine until the last time you measured the 'Dream Eater', right?"<br>
"It's level is higher than that time."<br>
"Then it's at least 'Old Existence' level or higher. What's its true name?"<br>
"I didn't figure it out."<br>
"Hmm."<br>
Han Sooyoung's expression became very serious.<br>
"The final scenario is right around the corner, and because of this kid, the Earth could be destroyed."<br>
I nodded calmly and said.<br>
"I'm really sorry. So please help me, Han Sooyoung."<br>
Han Sooyoung grumbled as if she was dumbfounded by my words.<br>
"This is really shameless."<br>
"You don't have a choice anyway. If you don't help me, your worldline will be destroyed."<br>
"What do you want me to help you with?"<br>
"Please help me return to the 41st round."<br>
As I said before, there are several conditions needed to 'move worldlines' in this world. However, I wasn't Yoo Joonghyuk, and I didn't have an 'ark' to cross worldlines like the constellations.<br>
So now, the only thing left for me is the last method.<br>
"I will make an Otherworldly Covenant."<br>
"Will that work now?"<br>
"Why not?"<br>
"With that kind of thing targeting you right now, do you think there would be an Outer God that wants to make an 'Otherwordly Covenant' with you?"<br>
Han Sooyoung was right.<br>
The otherworldly deity that is making an 'Otherworldly Covenant' right now will definitely clash with the outer god targeting me from beyond the 'Great Hall'.<br>
In other words, only a being stronger than the 'otherworldly deity' targeting me would accept my offer.<br>
"If the guy over there is stronger than the 'old being', then there is a possibility that he is at the level of the 'great old being'."<br>
Great old being.<br>
I kept my mouth shut at that expression that I had finally heard. Han Sooyoung added, how she had taken my silence unknown.<br>
"If the guy over there is at the 'great old being' level, then there will be no outer god that will help you."<br>
I knew it too.<br>
The outer god that reaches the 'great old being' level is a kind of 'mythical constellation' among the outer gods.<br>
Still, I shook my head.<br>
"No, it's not like there's no one."<br>
Even if the being that covets me from beyond is a 'Great Old Being', it's not like there's no Outer Deity that can stand against it.<br>
"You, really."<br>
Han Sooyoung's expression as she looked at me was strangely hardened. Perhaps she had realized it too.<br>
"The being that brought you to this 'worldline'."<br>
The only being that can stand against a 'Great Old Being' is a 'Great Old Being'.<br>
I took a deep breath and opened my mouth.<br>
"Han Sooyoung, please call 'Secretive Plotter'."

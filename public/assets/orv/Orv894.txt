894 Episode 49 tls123 (4)<br>
For an hour after that, I was beaten up here and there by Han Sooyoung. Maybe because I was beaten up so much, I could answer Han Sooyoung’s questions right away.<br>
"What major did you ?"<br>
"Creative Writing."<br>
"Oh, you must have won some awards at the 100th-day celebration when you were young?"<br>
"Only a reading award. Actually, I never learned writing separately, so I wasn’t very good at writing."<br>
"Really? But you must have learned some things when you went to college, right?"<br>
"Yes, I did."<br>
Actually, there were people who taught me. Anyway, I graduated from the Creative Writing Department, and I took novel classes from various professors. However, if you ask me if I learned writing from them, I don’t know what to say.<br>
But there is one professor I remember.<br>
「"■■-ah, are you having a hard time these days?"」<br>
It was around the time when I had not received any requests since my lucky debut.<br>
「"Have you ever thought about writing web novels?"」<br>
At that time, I was still not yet fully into pure literature, so I was depressed because I thought the professor's words meant, "You have no talent at all, so get out of the literary world." But now that I look back, that advice meant, "If you keep dying here, your life will be ruined."<br>
When I think of my peers who are having a hard time in the literary world, drinking, I want to give my professor a tip for his wisdom, but unfortunately, I can't even remember his name anymore. It was because I lost many of the memories I had while going through the 'Fear Realm'.<br>
"At first, it was hard to adapt to writing web novels."<br>
"Well, it must have been hard if you had come from pure literature. The writing style is very different."<br>
"I didn't know I would struggle that much. But I graduated from the Department of Creative Writing."<br>
"That's possible. In fact, our industry has a relatively low barrier to entry, right? Anyone can write if they have a keyboard."<br>
It didn't feel real at all that I was talking about web novels with Han Sooyoung.<br>
"Yes. Anyway, I had a hard time at first."<br>
"No one is good at writing from the beginning. Although there are geniuses sometimes."<br>
"You weren't good at writing at first either?"<br>
"I'm that genius?"<br>
I smiled bitterly as I watched Han Sooyoung smiling proudly.<br>
Even though she said that, I knew that she was the one who worked harder than anyone else.<br>
After all, she was someone who had serialized a novel that only one person read for over 10 years.<br>
"Come on, get up. We have to keep going."<br>
I sighed and got up from my seat.<br>
"Are you going to hit me again?"<br>
"Who said you'd just get hit? I told you to hit me too. Then I'll answer the questions you want?"<br>
"Easier said than done."<br>
"You only need to hit once, is that so hard?"<br>
"It's harder than when I first started reading web novels."<br>
She said one hit, but from my perspective, it seemed like Han Sooyoung was just beating me up under the pretense of training.<br>
"Is it because you've been studying pure literature? Your skill usage is so old-fashioned."<br>
"Honestly, how much pure literature have you read?"<br>
"Your basic stamina is also really poor."<br>
"I've never seen a writer with such good stamina."<br>
"For a writer, stamina that doesn't get tired even after working for three days and nights is a given. In my time—"<br>
I quickly used the story.<br>
[Story fragment, 'Way of the Wind', begins its storytelling!]<br>
[Way of the Wind], condensed into 'Unbreakable Faith', swirled and created a fierce sword wind.<br>
Han Sooyoung muttered as if it was interesting.<br>
"Oh, this one has good application?"<br>
Even so, my [Way of the Wind] didn’t even brush Han Sooyoung’s collar.<br>
I bit my lips and swung my sword again and again.<br>
Han Sooyoung kept asking questions while dodging my strikes here and there.<br>
"What’s the name of this skill?"<br>
"It’s [Way of the Wind], right?"<br>
"That’s the skill name. [Way of the Wind] isn’t used like that originally."<br>
"I didn’t give it a name."<br>
I’m not Killer King, so I wouldn’t have named every skill I used like "Dark Spinning Breaker".<br>
But Han Sooyoung looked at me as if I was pathetic.<br>
"Isn’t that skill your original? But you didn’t even give it a name?"<br>
"Why do you have to give it something like that?"<br>
"Because it becomes stronger with a name."<br>
I couldn’t understand what she meant.<br>
It becomes stronger with a name?<br>
"Extinction Sword (멸화검)."<br>
As Han Sooyoung muttered softly, a long purple sword spurted out from above the dagger she was holding.<br>
I stared at the shape of the sword spur and asked.<br>
"Extinction Sword? Isn't that just [Black Flame] stretched out and pulled out?"<br>
"Extinction Sword Form 1, Annihilation." (멸화검 제1식, 멸화개아.)<br>
Han Sooyoung shouted the name of the technique without paying attention to my tackle. Following that, the form of [After Flame] wrapped around Han Sooyoung's entire body like a flower bud, and soon deflected all the blade storms created by [Way of the Wind].<br>
[The constellation, 'Maritime War God's', eyes sparkle!]<br>
[The constellation, 'Bald General of Justice', is happy to see 'Extinction Sword' for the first time in a long time.]<br>
Messages from the constellations pouring down from the air.<br>
I felt like I could understand Han Sooyoung's words that I had to give it a name.<br>
"Form 2, Extinction." (제2식. 멸화분분.)<br>
Following that, a flower bud made of [Black Flame] opened. The sight of a flower made of pure purple energy blooming was captivating just by looking at it.<br>
The moment my gaze was captured by that scenery, the purple energy that had bloomed like petals scattering fragrance began to pour out in all directions.<br>
"Tch."<br>
I hurriedly activated the 'Blade of Faith', but it was not enough to counter the countless energy of [Black Flame]. In an instant, small  appeared on my arms and legs.<br>
I was purely astonished by the overwhelming difference in skill.<br>
Just as my skill relied on the source of [Way of the Wind], her skill was also based on [Black Flame]. However, the way she used [Black Flame] was much more sophisticated and delicate than how I used [Way of the Wind].<br>
Han Sooyoung shook her head and said.<br>
"It's not a difference in skill. It's a difference in imagination."<br>
A difference in imagination.<br>
"Even if you handle the story in the same way, the image of the technique changes completely depending on how you name it."<br>
I realized belatedly what she meant. It was true that I had only given it a name, but the image of the technique felt much clearer.<br>
A crouching flower bud and a blooming petal fluttering in the wind.<br>
The established name creates a framework for imagination and stimulates the curiosity of the constellations.<br>
[The constellation, 'Goryeo's Swordsman', feels the longing for the Murim.]<br>
Then.<br>
"Pungrang Island (풍랑섬)."<br>
I swung my sword with all my might. The magical power in my body drained away and the shape of the blade storm created by [Way of the Wind] changed.<br>
I thought of the wolf that had taught me [Way of the Wind]. The wolf of Immyuntar galloping across the plains of Chronos. The wolves running toward the sunset began to roar all at once.<br>
Kudduddud! The energy of [Way of the Wind] and [Black Flame] collided, creating a whirlwind.<br>
This side was slightly pushed back.<br>
I continued to supply my magical power and added [Baekcheongganggi] to the blade.<br>
"Baekrang Island (백랑섬)."<br>
(TL: Somebody, help? T~T …Anyway, I put the names in Korean here just in case.)<br>
The manes of the roaring wolves scattered silver. Some wolves were cut to death by the flower petals, but some wolves managed to bite the flower petals. With a sound of sparks, the magical power was canceled in the air, and [Black Flame] and [Way of the Wind] scattered into ash.<br>
Han Sooyoung smiled as if she was amazed.<br>
"You have good learning ability. Is 'Wind' (풍랑) borrowed from Lycaon's name?"<br>
(TL: ??? T~T idk)<br>
"That's right."<br>
I then activated other stories and skills one after another.<br>
[The story, 'Tenacious Martial Arts Master', begins its storytelling!]<br>
The Dragon's Head Ark of Opening, a story obtained from Cheon Gae.<br>
[Exclusive skill, 'Nakgak Breath Lv. 10', is activated!]<br>
The long breath sucked in by [Nakgak Breath] strengthened the magic circulation efficiency of 'Circulation Delay'. It was the result of practicing the skill linkage that the Demon King of Salvation had pointed out before.<br>
Han Sooyoung, who had exchanged a hundred or so combinations with me in an instant, nodded and said.<br>
"The skill set isn't that great, but the linkage isn't bad. You worked hard, didn't you?"<br>
I felt elated for no reason.<br>
I worked hard. It felt so good to be recognized for that.<br>
It felt like a certain sense that I had long forgotten was awakening again. Even though it was just clashing swords and telling stories that I had accumulated.<br>
"Don't get excited for no reason. We still have a long way to go. Is there anything else you know how to do?"<br>
"I can use Kim Dokja's power."<br>
Currently, I have accepted the 'First Kim Dokja'—the 'Demon King of Salvation'—and the 'Second Kim Dokja'—the 'King of Fear'. I was able to borrow their powers that remained in the [Fourth Wall] with the power of 'Heir of the Eternal Name'.<br>
"Try it."<br>
"Not now."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"I don't know."<br>
[Currently, a part of the 'Fourth Wall' is being restored.]<br>
[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name', refuses your request.]<br>
It seems that the [Fourth Wall] is not in good condition. The guy Heir is not listening to me either.<br>
Han Sooyoung asked, licking her lips.<br>
"This is difficult. What else?"<br>
"I can also use Cheon Inho's techniques."<br>
"[Incite]?"<br>
"Yes."<br>
"Then try that."<br>
Despite Han Sooyoung's suggestion, I hesitated a little this time. Because I experienced Cheon Inho's '40th round' in the Time Fault of the Fear Realm, my [Incite] had become quite strong. Right now, I was confident that even a mediocre constellation could kneel with just [Incite].<br>
"You'll get hurt."<br>
"Me?"<br>
Han Sooyoung said with a smirk.<br>
"Want to make a bet? If your incite works even a little, I'll grant you one wish."<br>
"Wish?"<br>
"Yes."<br>
"Don't regret it."<br>
I opened my mouth without hesitation.<br>
"You."<br>
I briefly thought about what [Incite] I should do. Since it's my first time, I'll go with something safe.<br>
"You're worse at writing than me."<br>
[Exclusive skill, Incite Lv.???', is activated!]<br>
Tsutsutsutsu.<br>
A spark flew in the air.<br>
Han Sooyoung stared at me blankly. Then, I felt a strong backlash in my incarnation body.<br>
[The story, 'One Who Rewrites Fate', offsets your probability aftershock.]<br>
As expected, I failed.<br>
"Would that spell work?"<br>
"You never know."<br>
"The basics aren't right. Before [inciting], you should analyze what kind of emotional state the other person is in."<br>
I was about to say that I analyzed a little bit, but stopped myself.<br>
"If I had even the slightest thought that I might lose to you, would that [inciting] work?"<br>
"Then what should I have [incited] you?"<br>
"You have to find . Other than this? No more?"<br>
"No more."<br>
[Exclusive skill, 'Incite Lv.???', is activated!]<br>
Han Sooyoung's smile deepened.<br>
"That's pretty good. I almost believed it."<br>
"What a shame."<br>
Actually, Han Sooyoung was right. I still had one more important asset left.<br>
"You, do you have a 'Giant Tale'?"<br>
"I do, but I don't know how to use it yet. To be exact, it’s in a state where it can’t be used."<br>
"What does that mean?"<br>
I thought about it for a moment and decided to be honest.<br>
"It’s not just 'skills' that need a name to be used properly."<br>
"You haven’t gotten a name for it yet, have you?"<br>
"Yes."<br>
"When did you get the giant story?"<br>
"Well, it’s been quite some time."<br>
"Then, the <Star Stream> must have given it to you?"<br>
Han Sooyoung approached me with a puzzled expression and grabbed my wrist. Her story began to rush into me.<br>
And as if to oppose her story, a strong energy boiled inside me.<br>
The 'giant story' was resisting Han Sooyoung’s story. As if it was rejecting all of her stories.<br>
"Look at this?"<br>
Han Sooyoung, who had been briefly confronting the story, opened her mouth as if she found it interesting.<br>
"This guy is refusing to be given a name?"

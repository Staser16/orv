904 Episode 50 The World After The End (7)<br>
"Demon King?"<br>
The judge's expression was expressed by Jo Jincheol's one word.<br>
"Jo daehyeop! What do you mean, Demon King?"<br>
"With your tongue... you fooled people?"<br>
"Tongue, with his tongue? Is there a Demon King related to the tongue?"<br>
As the incarnations in the audience began to get curious one by one, Jo Jincheol's mouth continued to move.<br>
"...A new world requires new laws."<br>
Huh?<br>
"I'll knock you all out of that damn sky!"<br>
Huh?<br>
"... I have my own life?"<br>
Wait a minute. Is this kid reading the original story?<br>
"What the hell are you talking about, Jo daehyeop. What kind of being is this newbie?"<br>
Jo Jincheol answered in a deep breath.<br>
"Amazing. I think I only have a few stories of great-grade, but if there is a person who has this kind of story, then he might be the talent our ancestors were looking for."<br>
"If it's our ancestors..."<br>
"The great master of <Black Cloud>!"<br>
"Whoa!"<br>
Looking at the examiner who fell over in surprise, I briefly wondered if this might be some kind of surprise newcomer party.<br>
"On the planet I lived on, there were guys with a trait called 'middle school syndrome'. A devilish talent that pushed their delusions to the limit and eventually made them a reality..."<br>
As I listened to the story, I vaguely thought I knew what Jo Jincheol had seen in me.<br>
「"Most constellations that see you will probably experience cognitive dissonance. It will be hard to accept that someone who is neither a constellation nor a transcendental constellation has such a strangely great status.<br>
If they acknowledge you, the constellations will have to accept that an incarnation that is nothing is stronger than them.<br>
So ordinary constellations will not be able to face your existence and will only read fragments of distorted stories."」<br>
Is that why she was curious about what other constellations would see in me?<br>
I was about to tell them that it was a complete misunderstanding, but Jo Jincheol, whose eyes had changed, shouted at me excitedly.<br>
"Come to our <Black Cloud Foundation>. With your talent, I can contact the foundation's main server right now and help you download [Black Flame Sky Dance]."<br>
Black Flame Sky Dance. It's a martial art that I don't want to learn just by hearing its name.<br>
But the others seemed to have different thoughts.<br>
"The <Black Cloud Foundation> made the first offer to recruit him?"<br>
"Black Flame Sky! Oh my goodness. Isn't that the unique martial arts of the <Black Cloud Foundation> executives?"<br>
"He's a really enviable new recruit."<br>
The situation was taking a strange turn.<br>
The examiner lightly tapped my shoulder and said.<br>
"You're really lucky. Judging from your expression, I don't think you understand what's going on yet, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."<br>
"..."<br>
"Black Cloud Foundation is one of the 'big corporations in the New Murim District. If you can ascend through that company, your future will be..."<br>
I was about to say that it didn't seem like a very positive future, but then I heard the people around me talking.<br>
"Damn, another parachute has appeared. You damned constellation-spooners."<br>
"I'm jealous, though."<br>
The expressions were filled with envy and jealousy.<br>
Listening to the rumbling voices, my mood became complicated for no reason. Perhaps the possibility of incarnation is mostly determined by the first scenario, 'Proof of Value'.<br>
The incarnations who survived until now without receiving proper sponsor selection still have to endure life waiting for the selection of the higher constellations.<br>
"Damn it. If only I could go to a large company..."<br>
In the main story, Kim Dokja became a constellation on his own without sponsor selection, but not everyone can take that path.<br>
I was worried about my colleagues again. Even if it was true that Dansu ahjussi and Ji Eunyu-ssi were selected by narrative-grade constellations, what would have happened to the other colleagues who did not choose at the sponsor selection?<br>
The examiner patted my shoulder again and said.<br>
"...So, if you enter the Black Cloud Foundation and polish your stories for about ten years, you can become an ascendant like Jo daehyeop and become a dragon who assists the great Black Cloud Master. Do you know what kind of being the Black Cloud Master is?"<br>
"I've heard of it."<br>
"That's right. Haha, you can't help but know. He's closer to the 'Final Dragon of the Apocalypse' than any other existing dragon!"<br>
In short, if you join there and suffer for ten years, you can become the Black Flame Dragon's footstool.<br>
This human, if he knew that I was chosen by the 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' in the first scenario's sponsor selection, he'd probably faint.<br>
I was about to express my intention to refuse without hesitation, but unfortunately someone interrupted me.<br>
"Why are you having such a pleasant conversation without me?"<br>
It was Paradise Emperor Reinheit.<br>
Jo Jincheol, sensing something strange, quickly blocked his way and warned him.<br>
"Paradise Emperor, it's not your place to interfere. Our Black Cloud Foundation has already decided to recruit this cute guy."<br>
"I don't think you've heard that incarnation's opinion yet?"<br>
"There's no need to listen! What kind of incarnation would dare to refuse to be recruited by the Foundation!"<br>
"It seems you've already forgotten about the Gwanggeomje incident."<br>
Jo Jincheol's expression hardened.<br>
"Gwanggeomje! Why are you bringing up that crazy woman?"<br>
"Even back then, didn't Jo daehyeop misread the story and recklessly try to recruit her, and the Foundation branch was almost destroyed?"<br>
"You!"<br>
"Please give me a chance too. Maybe he's a better fit for <Olympus Technology> than <Black Cloud Foundation>?"<br>
Reinheit ignored the indignant Jo Jincheol and turned his ominous eyes toward me.<br>
"Hmm..."<br>
The guy unleashed the power of the constellation and began to read my stories. It was the exact method Jo Jincheol had used.<br>
I wondered what kind of strange things I would hear this time.<br>
"It's amazing. Even that 'Jehwayosung' wouldn't have been able to build such a noble story in a scenario of the same level…"<br>
The examiner was surprised by Reinheit's words and asked again.<br>
"Have you ever seen Jehwayosung?"<br>
"I've seen them once from afar. They're as beautiful as the rumors say. I couldn't get close because of the tale of the Monkey King…"<br>
The Monkey King?<br>
It sounds like a story about someone I know.<br>
"Anyway, it's been a long time since I've seen an incarnation come up here with such a clear soul."<br>
At that moment, Reinheit's [Echo] came into my ear.<br>
—Excuse me, which great demon king's retinue are you?<br>
Hmm?<br>
"He's the one who saved countless souls and built up good stories."<br>
When I glared at him, he continued [Echo] with a deep smile.<br>
—Although I can't read your essence, I can strongly sense the tale of 'hypocrisy' from you. Hoho, how many beings have you deceived?<br>
Look at this kid?<br>
"Unless you've received the grace of an archangel, it would be difficult to build such a good story…"<br>
—With this level of sorcery, you must have deceived countless constellations to get here. Above all, your narrow eyes that even this power cannot see through…<br>
The attendees of the ascension ceremony stirred once again.<br>
"The grace of an archangel? Is he from <Eden>?"<br>
"But <Eden> wouldn't have opened a branch in the 'New Murim District'—"<br>
"You can only have an incarnation that has received grace. Either way, it's a great thing."<br>
Before long, the whole place was filled with stories about me.<br>
Taking advantage of the atmosphere, Reinheit made a suggestion.<br>
"Come to our <Olympus Technology>."<br>
—I don't know why you left the demon world and came here… but if a high-ranking demon lord's agent came here, it means there must be some unavoidable circumstance. <Olympus> can protect you. Even if you are being chased by <Eden>.<br>
It seemed like he had a huge misunderstanding about me.<br>
He must have judged me to be a high-ranking demon lord who was expelled from the demon world or something similar…<br>
Thinking about it carefully, it was unfair that I couldn’t say it was a misunderstanding.<br>
In the meantime, Jo Jincheol intervened again.<br>
"What nonsense are you talking about, Reinheit! You said you only followed the goddess of beauty around, but now your eyes have become distorted. Archangel? A good story? Where can you read stories like that from this guy! This guy is a talent of the 'Black Cloud Foundation'! Hey, ignore that nonsense! I’ll write a letter of recommendation myself!"<br>
"A-a letter of recommendation from an ascendant!"<br>
I don’t know much about letters of recommendation, but it seems to be a great privilege here.<br>
The examiner nodded happily as if he had read my expression and explained.<br>
"You’re still a newbie, so you don’t know much, but if you get a letter of recommendation and join, you should be able to become eligible for Ascension in at least 5 years depending on your efforts. Even if you learn [Black Flame Spring]…!"<br>
In short, it was a story that the time it would take to become the Black Flame Dragon’s footstool would be shortened from 10 years to 5 years.<br>
What an incredible benefit.<br>
I was about to readily express my intention to decline, but this time Reinheit intervened.<br>
"If you join our <Olympus Technology>, we will put you on the Ascension Platform within 3 years."<br>
"3 years! Oh my god!"<br>
I smiled bitterly.<br>
I don’t know for sure, but there must be a heated debate going on inside the [Fourth Wall] about 'Becoming an Olympus Slave vs. Becoming a Black Flame Dragon Footstool' right now.<br>
"It doesn’t end here. If you become an Ascendant, I will personally recommend you as the incarnation of the 12 Gods of <Olympus>."<br>
The room was filled with shock. Olympus's 12 Seats.<br>
If I didn't know much about <Olympus>, it would have been a tempting suggestion.<br>
"Oh my! Is the Paradise Emperor sincere?"<br>
"If it's the Paradise Emperor, then it's possible. I heard that the Paradise Emperor was also selected as an incarnation candidate for one of the 12 Seats this time."<br>
This time, I was a little surprised.<br>
That Reinheit is the incarnation of one of the 12 Seats?<br>
[Exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall', activates!]<br>
I instinctively felt wary.<br>
If Reinheit was a terminal incarnation directly connected to the <Olympus> 12 Seats, then this situation was dangerous.<br>
<Olympus> had clashed with me several times in the 'Recycling Center' and the 'Fear Realm'. Even if it had been quite some time, if it was a 12 Seats-level, they might recognize my identity.<br>
At that moment, the sky above the Ascension Platform was rippling ominously. Intermittent sparks began to flow around Reinheit's brainwashing window.<br>
I quickly turned my hood over and asked.<br>
"Excuse me, but I have a different company I would like to join."<br>
The examiner, startled by my words, asked.<br>
"Huh? What do you mean?"<br>
I looked around the room. The incarnations gathered here were each wearing uniforms with different company symbols or names on them. However, no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find the company name I was looking for.<br>
"You're crazy. You're looking for another company when you have the ascendants of <Black Cloud Foundation> and <Olympus Technology> right in front of you?"<br>
"Are you a kid who still can't see?"<br>
If I was going to be the Black Flame Dragon's footstool or the terminal incarnation of <Olympus> in the first place, I wouldn't have gone through all that trouble and come this far.<br>
While everyone else was making expressions of bewilderment, only Reinheit was looking at me with profound eyes.<br>
"Interesting. You rejected <Black Cloud Foundation> and <Olympus Technology> and chose the 'third option'? Somehow, a famous anecdote comes to mind."<br>
"Heh heh. Keuhahahaha!"<br>
Jo Jincheol burst into laughter as well. I wondered what was so funny about my answer. Then, Jo Jincheol stopped laughing for a moment and looked at me.<br>
"You, do you think you can be a 'Kim Dokja'?"

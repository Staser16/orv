910 Episode 51 8 years (2)<br>
When I first saw the 'collector' message, I had a feeling that it might be true.<br>
But the head that appeared beyond the swirling portal was not an unfamiliar one.<br>
[What number is this? You really want to ruin the company, don't you?]<br>
A dokkaebi with soft fur like a formless one. I had seen it at the 'Twelve Zodiac Ball'.<br>
「Dokkaebi Yeonggi.」<br>
The spirit giggled as it spun its head around in the air.<br>
[Huh? Why aren't you answering? Are you thinking of not paying this time either?]<br>
Looking at that Yeonggi, I thought of the setting of the main story.<br>
This kind of collection work is usually given to low-level dokkaebis or demoted dokkaebis.<br>
Even after 8 years, has he still not escaped being a low-level dokkaebi?<br>
Even his personality was clearly different from the 'Yeonggi' I knew. If the original Yeonggi was a 'rookie' who didn't understand what was being said but worked hard, the current Yeonggi seemed like a guy who had met the wrong shooter and only learned strange things.<br>
[You're not going to pay? You're not going to pay? You're not going to pay? You're not going to pay? You know what happens if you don't pay?]<br>
Yeonggi's neck started spinning around and the atmosphere started to change like a horror movie.<br>
"Didn't I tell you to wait a little longer!"<br>
The one who said those words was Namgung Myung, who had hurriedly opened the door and came in.<br>
Namgung Myung looked around at Kyung Sein, me, and Yeonggi who were standing there awkwardly, then hurriedly lowered his head and added.<br>
"I'm, I'm sorry, benefactor. It's not the time for tax collection yet, so I didn't expect a tax collector to come by all of a sudden..."<br>
Kyung Sein let out a light sigh and stepped forward to stop Namgung Myung.<br>
"I'm sorry, but I still need time to prepare."<br>
[I think I heard that last time too—?]<br>
"Just give me a little more time. You won't get coins that didn't exist if you keep urging me like that."<br>
Kyung Sein's voice was quite calm as she answered. If it were the Kyung Sein I remember, she would have made a fuss and hidden behind me, and said, "Dokja-ssi, try to do something."<br>
[Huh.]<br>
The spinning Yeonggi's neck stopped.<br>
[What are you so proud of? What's there to brag about not being able to pay taxes?]<br>
"..."<br>
[The deferrals up until now were close to special treatment. How strange. Why would the higher-ups be interested in such a small business? Anyway, that special treatment ends today. I can't wait any longer.]<br>
"Even if you say that, it's difficult right now—"<br>
[No. If it weren't for another incarnation, you would have a 'way to pay', right?]<br>
Kyung Sein's face turned pale. Kyung Sein, who had been staring blankly into space, soon opened her mouth with a face of resignation.<br>
"Okay."<br>
[Huh. Okay. Then shall we start collecting?]<br>
I don't know exactly what 'collecting' Yeonggi meant, but judging from Kyung Sein's reaction, it didn't seem like a good thing.<br>
"Wait a minute."<br>
The moment a bright light appeared on Yeonggi's fingers, I stepped forward as if to protect Kyung Sein.<br>
"I don't know what it is, but I will pay the tax instead."<br>
[Huh? What is this?]<br>
I was puzzled by Yeonggi's expression as he glared at me with a bad look.<br>
[How long have you been there?]<br>
He didn't recognize me?<br>
That was odd.<br>
A dokkaebi from the Management Bureau, who is not even another being, didn't recognize me?<br>
[You seem like an incarnation I've never seen before, so don't meddle in things that don't concern you and just stay quiet. If you don’t want to get screwed.]<br>
Not only that, the guy didn’t seem to remember me.<br>
I thought it was a good thing.<br>
"If I’m someone related?"<br>
[What do you mean?]<br>
"It’s my company’s business, so there’s no way it wouldn’t be related."<br>
At those words, Yeonggi’s head suddenly turned toward Kyung Sein.<br>
[Is this incarnation a new employee?]<br>
Just before Kyung Sein shook her head urgently, I interjected.<br>
"I just got hired. So I have the obligation to take on the company’s debt as well."<br>
[There’s no way… There’s an incarnation that gets hired at a company like this? You’re joking, right?]<br>
"Dokkaebi Yeonggi, does that matter now? You’re just going to collect taxes anyway, right?"<br>
When I mentioned the guy’s name, Yeonggi’s expression changed once again.<br>
[Huh, does a mere incarnation know me?]<br>
"Uh."<br>
[No, it seems like you don’t know. If you really knew me, you wouldn't act like that...]<br>
Namgung Myung took a step toward me, perhaps sensing that the situation was taking a turn for the worse.<br>
I raised my hand to him as a sign that I was okay, and continued to speak.<br>
"You seem to be the one who doesn't know much. Are they teaching the dokkaebis at the Management Bureau to act like that these days?"<br>
Yeonggi looked down at me with a blank expression for a moment, as if he didn't understand what I was saying, and then laughed in vain.<br>
But I'm also dumbfounded.<br>
[How dare a bug...]<br>
He even brought out his 'bug' repertoire, as if he were a successor.<br>
"Why, you'll make my head explode?"<br>
[Do you think you can't?]<br>
"Have you forgotten which scenario this is? Do you still think this is a tutorial?"<br>
A faint anger began to form in Yeonggi's two eyes. The power of the Management Bureau was in the guy's eyes, shining faintly.<br>
[You're very confident. If you think that killing a bug will cause trouble when there are no constellations to see—]<br>
"Why do you think there are no constellations to see?"<br>
[What?]<br>
The next moment, I let out a blast. A loud noise shook the entire garden.<br>
There it was.<br>
Kyung Sein, who was startled, looked back at me, and Namgung Myung, whose face turned pale, slumped down. Of course, the most surprised one was dokkaebi Yeonggi.<br>
[This is ridiculous…]<br>
Yeonggi, who was startled, trembled and asked me.<br>
[Oh, were you by any chance a constellation?]<br>
In times like this, it's best to just laugh silently like Kim Dokja.<br>
[What? Why can't I see the relevant information… And the modifier… What on earth are you?]<br>
It's probably because of the [Fourth Wall] that he can't access my information.<br>
Yeonggi must be perplexed. A mere incarnation has the status of a constellation, and it must be a situation where he can't even look up modifiers. I decided to help him out a little.<br>
"If you're really curious, open the 'Dokkaebi Bag'."<br>
Yeonggi listened to me obediently.<br>
And after a while.<br>
[H, how on earth?]<br>
'Dokkaebi Bag' has a system that assigns 'membership levels' by referencing the constellation's item purchase history.<br>
And as far as I know, the level of my former sponsor, 'Demon King of Salvation's' Dokkaebi Bag is...<br>
[Diamond level...?]<br>
Yeonggi's eyes widened and he looked back and forth between the screen in front of him and me, exuding shock.<br>
As expected, it seemed that the 'Dokkaebi Bag' level of the 'Demon King of Salvation' had been transferred to me.<br>
I guess I'm seeing the benefit of having a good sponsor here too.<br>
[Demon King of Salvation? The owner of this modifier must have already disappeared? Why do you have the right to use it...]<br>
"You don't need to know that. I think this is enough proof that I have the ability to pay."<br>
Yeonggi groaned as if he didn’t want to admit it, then opened his mouth in a much more polite tone.<br>
[Are you really going to pay your taxes in advance?]<br>
"Yes. How many coins?"<br>
Fortunately, I had quite a few coins.<br>
However, the words that came out of Yeonggi’s mouth were somewhat unexpected.<br>
[100,000 D coins.]<br>
Namgung Myung, who was next to me, shouted in protest.<br>
"Wait a minute! There can’t be that many! Last time, I’m sure…"<br>
[You seem to have forgotten how much tax arrears there have been. All tax arrears accrue interest.]<br>
"I know that, but…"<br>
[The Management Office is not a poverty relief agency. And originally, you were supposed to pay 101,235 D coins, but since you, Diamond, specially agreed to pay in advance, I’ve reduced the rest.]<br>
Yeonggi looked back at me and asked.<br>
[Will you pay your tax arrears?]<br>
"I don’t have any D coins. Can’t I just pay in coins?"<br>
Then Yeonggi laughed.<br>
[In this 'scenario area', only 'D Coins' are circulated.]<br>
"Why don't you exchange the coins for D coins? What's the rate?"<br>
Yeonggi's eyes started rolling at my words. Even at first glance, he had an expression that seemed to have an ulterior motive.<br>
[If that's true, I'll exchange 10,000 coins for 1 D Coin.]<br>
10,000 coins for 1 D Coin.<br>
This kid must have learned how to catch people somewhere.<br>
"Did we have coin inflation? The exchange rate can't be like that, right?"<br>
[In principle, currency exchange is not allowed in this scenario area. This is also a suggestion I made because you are a Diamond member...]<br>
No matter how much the coins rot, there's no way they would exchange them at that rate.<br>
[Would you like to exchange them?]<br>
"Would you?"<br>
[Then let's just pretend that the tax payment never happened... ]<br>
As if the results were visible, Yeonggi spoke with a shameless face.<br>
I grinned.<br>
Yeah, that’s how you come out.<br>
"I’ll pay it. Before that, I have one question."<br>
[Hmm? Go ahead.]<br>
"What authority do you have to carry out this 'collection work'?"<br>
Yeonggi tilted his head as if he didn’t understand what I was saying and asked back.<br>
[What do you mean? I’m a dokkaebi in charge of the collection mission, so of course I have the authority to collect, right?]<br>
"That’s talking about other companies. It seems like the higher-ups didn’t specifically issue a collection order to this company?"<br>
The guy clearly said it with his own mouth.<br>
The higher-ups are giving Kyung Sein's company a 'deferral close to special treatment'.<br>
That meant that someone in the management office was 'looking after this company' so that they could defer their taxes.<br>
[That’s… ]<br>
"I don't know where the guy who couldn't even properly explain the scenario learned such bad things and is acting like this..."<br>
Yeonggi looked like he was hit with a sharp look. Looking at him, I somehow felt like I knew who the 'dokkaebi who's looking after this company' was.<br>
"Does Bihyung know that you're doing this here?"<br>
At Bihyung's name, Yeonggi's face turned pale for a moment. I didn't miss the opportunity and continued to speak.<br>
"It seems Bihyung doesn't know, does he?"<br>
After hesitating for a moment, Yeonggi let out a faint sigh and answered.<br>
[I don't know how you know that person, but even if you tell Bihyung, I can't give up on this collection.]<br>
It was a stronger response than I thought.<br>
Did he receive instructions from another high-level dokkaebi other than Bihyung?<br>
I thought for a moment and then said.<br>
"Then give me a little more grace."<br>
[How much...]<br>
"A week."<br>
[A week is too long.]<br>
"Instead, I'll keep it a secret from him."<br>
[…]<br>
"I don’t know why the management office needs something like D-coins, but I can pay the taxes. I just want a little more time."<br>
After thinking for a moment, Yeonggi answered.<br>
[Okay. Since you seem to be close with Bihyoung, I will accept your offer. However, if you still can’t pay after a week, I will force the company’s executives to 'collect' the money.]<br>
Yeonggi gave Kyung Sein a fierce look, then turned to me and said.<br>
[I don’t know why someone like you is here, but I hope you have the grace of the story.]<br>
With those words, Yeonggi disappeared beyond the swirling portal.<br>
Namgung Myung looked at me with a somewhat impressed expression, and Kyung Sein looked at my toes with a complicated expression.<br>
"Inho-ssi, you don’t have to go this far."<br>
"I did it because I wanted to."<br>
Kyung Sein’s eyes were red.<br>
"Inho-ssi… why?"<br>
"Why? We're colleagues."<br>
"Why, why did you come now…"<br>
As she was saying that, Kyung Sein's breathing began to tremble.<br>
"Why, why on earth did you come now… Are you making me expect…"<br>
Kyung Sein, who had been muttering quietly, began to stumble.<br>
"Sein-ssi?"<br>
I hurriedly grabbed Kyung Sein, who was falling forward. Kyung Sein's entire body felt hot as if it were on fire.<br>
"Inho-ssi, you shouldn't get involved in this scenario."<br>
"Wait a minute. Sein-ssi, the incarnation…"<br>
I realized the moment my hand touched her. Kyung Sein's condition was so serious that I couldn't understand how she could have talked normally in such a body.<br>
"If that happens, Inho-ssi too…"<br>
With those words, Kyung Sein lost consciousness.<br>
I felt Kyung Sein's pulse as she fell and checked the state of her hair.<br>
Kyung Sein's hair was deeply damaged.<br>
No, it wasn't just 'damage'.<br>
It was like…<br>
「A wound that felt like someone had ripped a part of her soul off.」<br>
I laid Kyung Sein down neatly and held her hand.<br>
Just by holding her hand, I could tell what kind of life she had been through. I felt like it was becoming clearer little by little what I had to do here.<br>
I looked down at Kyung Sein who was sleeping and slowly opened my mouth.<br>
"Gungmyung-ssi, how can I get something called D-coins?"

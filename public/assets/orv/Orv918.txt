918 Episode 52 Light Sword Emperor (3)<br>
A suffocating storm of white and blue struck the manor.<br>
The three ascendants, their faces paling, simultaneously dodged.<br>
A spark of probability erupted eerily from the dust.<br>
Sentences then emerged.<br>
「This power? Could that constellation be...?」<br>
「That can't be. That constellation must have died then!」<br>
「Nonsense...!」<br>
Sentences that seemed to be the inner thoughts of the recorders. They didn't seem to have been written directly by them; perhaps they were part of their subconscious.<br>
"Everyone, wake up! The record is leaking!"<br>
The 'Unchanging One' warned, and the intermittent lines of text abruptly cut off.<br>
"Don't panic! It's the same as a narrative-grade! And there are three of us!"<br>
Perhaps not yet fully grasping the situation, the ascendants seemed to be regrouping. I said to those guys.<br>
"They're not the same narrative-grade."<br>
Five stars shining from my entire body. I gradually drew on the power contained within the constellation.<br>
[Your incarnation is overloaded!]<br>
Power acquired after enduring the 1,863rd round with Han Sooyoung.<br>
AKA 'Demon King of Salvation' mode.<br>
Use time is approximately 5 minutes.<br>
Instantaneous combat power is 'late stage of narrative-grade.'<br>
"Wh, what... the level keeps rising!"<br>
"Don't be intimidated by the level alone! I've heard information about that guy! That constellation's combat prowess isn't that great compared to its level!"<br>
I was a little surprised by the accuracy of the information.<br>
As he said, the 'Demon King of Salvation' didn't have great combat skills compared to his level.<br>
But the reason the 'Demon King of Salvation' is so scary isn't because of his 'powerful techniques'.<br>
"Heir, I'll borrow another story."<br>
With a tsutsutsu, a new story was added to the constellation.<br>
[The story, 'Insect Massacre', begins its storytelling.]<br>
Story 「Insect Massacre」.<br>
A story that unleashes overwhelming power when the opponent is 'weaker' than the story's owner.<br>
The sphere surrounding my incarnation body began to glow even brighter.<br>
[This story resonates with the constellation 'Demon King of Salvation'!]<br>
The reason the Demon King of Salvation is so terrifying is because his story affinity is unparalleled among other constellations.<br>
The story's power, instantly activated, took control of the entire area through my body.<br>
"That's—"<br>
The ascended beings, recognizing the story, retreated.<br>
But it was too late.<br>
In a flash, Baekcheong's sword swung, slicing off the head of one ascended being.<br>
"First, one."<br>
Even if it were the 'Insect Massacre' unleashed by the 'Demon King of Salvation', this story, born of 'great-grade' origins, wouldn't work well against beings possessing a certain level of power.<br>
For example, with someone like Yoo Joonghyuk, who had only faced overwhelmingly stronger opponents, 'Insect Massacre' couldn't fully demonstrate its capabilities.<br>
But the ones before me were different.<br>
"R-R-Run! We must inform the other ascendants!"<br>
The ascendants before me had relied solely on their own power, crushing only weaker opponents. That was why they were dying now. Their history had become their weakness.<br>
"Two."<br>
[White-Blue Ganggi], overlaid with [Way of the Wind], decapitated another ascendant.<br>
As the two incarnations crumbled in vain, the constellation's terrifying scream echoed through the air.<br>
[The constellation, 'Twins Who Own Horses', suffer a massive blow and are removed from the scenario!]<br>
Interestingly, the recorders who recorded them are in a similar situation.<br>
[The Recorder of Fear, 'One Who Writes Youth', loses his records and enters a period of inactivity.]<br>
[The Recorder of Fear, 'One Who Doesn't Like Twists', loses his records and enters a period of inactivity.]<br>
It seems the Recorders of Fear who signed a 'recording contract' take a major blow when the contracted incarnation dies.<br>
So that's why Bihyung said I only need to deal with the contracted incarnation.<br>
In any case, this leaves only one thing.<br>
I turned my head to see a terrified Yoon Hyunseok preparing to flee.<br>
Normally, he would have thrown a tantrum, having been cornered.<br>
[The constellation, 'Parrot of Desire', lowers the synchronisation with the incarnation.]<br>
Unfortunately, the guy's sponsor seemed to have made an unusual choice.<br>
"Spo, Sponsor?"<br>
Feeling his own status rapidly diminishing, Executive Director Yoon Hyunseok wore a blank expression.<br>
"Hey, wait. Don't come! I told you not to come!"<br>
If he were to lower his synchronisation with the incarnation in this situation, his purpose was clear.<br>
Since this was a losing battle anyway, he'd probably lower his synchronisation to lessen the damage to his true form.<br>
But I couldn't just let him run away. I pulled the 'Four Yin Demonic Demonic Sword' from my pocket.<br>
[The S+-grade item 'Four Yin Demonic Demonic Sword' evolves into the holy relic 'Four Yin Demonic Demonic Sword.']<br>
Originally, it could only be used with the power of the Big Dipper, but at the level of a narrative-grade constellation, it could be replaced with one's own constellation.<br>
My stories were imbued into the hilt of the 'Four Yin Demonic Demonic Sword', and a bright starlight was engraved on its blade.<br>
[The constellation, 'Desire Parrot', looks at you in astonishment!]<br>
[The constellation, 'Desire Parrot', implores you. If you do not kill its incarnation-]<br>
Swinging the 'Four Yin Demonic Demonic Sword', it slashed at its chest.<br>
Immediately, a horrifying scream and the constellation's message were heard.<br>
[The constellation, 'Desire Parrot', suffered a massive blow and was forced out of the scenario!]<br>
Leaving Yoon Hyunseok behind, who had collapsed to the ground, spilling his stories, I retrieved the D-Coins dropped by the dead executives.<br>
[You have acquired a total of 25,300 D-Coins.]<br>
As expected of an executive, he had quite a lot of D-Coins.<br>
At this rate, I should be able to collect 100,000 D-Coins in no time.<br>
[The story, 'Heir of the Eternal Name' is retrieving the stories you borrowed.]<br>
Just then, the time limit for 'Salvation Demon King Mode' expired. I tasted blood on my tongue. I forced myself to remain calm and swallowed my breath.<br>
A faint spark coursed through my body.<br>
I guess five stories is still too much.<br>
"Benefactor, are you alright?"<br>
"Inho-ssi—!"<br>
I saw Namgung Myung and Kyung Sein, who had retreated for a moment, approaching.<br>
I held out my palm to them, signaling them not to move.<br>
Yoon Hyunseok's lifeline was still attached.<br>
"Keuk..."<br>
Even though he couldn't use the power of his sponsor, I couldn't let my guard down forever.<br>
I approached him, maintaining [Baekcheongganggi].<br>
"S-Spare me, spare me… "<br>
I looked down at him and said,<br>
"I have some questions for your 'Recorder'."<br>
When I mentioned the Recorder's existence, Yoon Hyunseok's body trembled as if struck by lightning.<br>
[The Recorder of Fear, the 'Unchanging One', is staring at you!]<br>
Then, as if waiting, a message flashed through my mind.<br>
[The Recorder of Fear, the 'Unchanging One', expects your generosity!]<br>
There was a reason I kept him alive in the first place. There was information I needed to uncover.<br>
What on earth are so many Recorders plotting in this city?<br>
What are the dokkaebis thinking hiring these guys?<br>
Perhaps this 'Recorder' before me knows all that information.<br>
"What do I get if I spare you?"<br>
[The Recorder of Fear, the 'Unchanging One', offers D-Coins!]<br>
"That's not necessary."<br>
Considering what happened to my eldest brother, I had no intention of letting any of them live.<br>
Still, I finally got the information. I couldn't miss this opportunity to rip it out.<br>
But the next moment, instead of his answer, I heard his inner thoughts.<br>
「Just a little more time.」<br>
Huh?<br>
「It'll be 'that time' soon. If we take refuge in the 'Records Archive' before we lose the contract, we can avoid the end of writing...!」<br>
Records Archive?<br>
Sensing something odd, I was about to swing my sword at Yoon Hyunseok's arm when...<br>
「Hahahaha! That's it! It's two o'clock!」<br>
A bright light emanated from Yoon Hyunseok's entire body, and soon a translucent energy surged through him.<br>
The next moment, what looked like a pen mark the guy had left rippled through the air. I reached out and firmly grasped it, and a message flashed before my eyes.<br>
[Would you like to enter the 'Records Archive' in that area?]<br>
Seeing the message, something occurred to me.<br>
「"Hmm. I heard there's a separate space only the recorders can access..."」<br>
It seems I've finally figured out where the 'subspace' Bihyung spoke of was.<br>
*<br>
A pure white, circular space reminiscent of a gigantic Colosseum. Fierce sentences were floating in real time above the space's margins.<br>
「Blood Jade Fist Master Jo Jincheol shouted, "Damn it, Light Sword Emperor! I won't miss this time!"」<br>
「Paradise Emperor Reinheit gritted his teeth. "As expected, Light Sword Emperor. He truly lives up to his reputation."」<br>
「Nirvana, filled with madness, shouted, "Hahahaha! Where did you go!? Become one with me!"」<br>
As various incidents unfolded in the city, a dozen or so recorders scribbled on the screens, examining each one.<br>
「...Auction house unusual report...」<br>
「...High-level fragment analysis. Currently assessing probability...」<br>
What was unusual was that each recorder wore a mask. Most were blue or purple, but occasionally green and orange masks were seen.<br>
The recorder wearing the orange mask spoke first.<br>
【What happened to the order from the nebula? Has there been any change?】<br>
The green mask beside him answered.<br>
【It's the same. I've protested several times, but they say the decision won't be reversed. The city will be closed in the next scenario.】<br>
【Is that how it's going to end?】<br>
The orange mask spoke in a dejected tone. The city's scenery was reflected in his eyes behind his mask.<br>
「New Murim District.」<br>
Until now, this city has been divided into two parts, the remnants of the fallen Fear Realm. Its lifespan was sustained by the power of the three.<br>
The fragments of the Fear Realm that were occasionally unearthed were refined into 'D-Coins', and these 'D-Coins' were transmitted to the constellations in the higher scenarios, proving their worth.<br>
However, the vitality of such a system was limited.<br>
【If only the Light Sword Emperor hadn't destroyed the orbital elevator...】<br>
When the orbital elevator was destroyed, the D-Coin circulation route was blocked, and naturally, the ascenders who had become stronger through D-Coins also found their path to ascending blocked.<br>
A single incarnation brought the entire city's system to its knees.<br>
【In fact, this was expected even without the Light Sword Emperor. The story fragments found in the Fear Realm were practically nonexistent.】<br>
The Light Sword Emperor was merely a trigger. Perhaps the constellations in the higher scenarios simply concluded that the city had outlived its usefulness.<br>
【That's true. Wasn't there a harvest worth using this week?】<br>
【There was talk of an 'end-level fragment' being discovered during the day...】<br>
【End-level fragment?】<br>
【Yes. The situation was so absurd that the new recruits stepped in and altered the records. The 'Management Bureau' is also investigating the probability of the scale.】<br>
【End-level fragment...】<br>
【If that's true, the giant nebulae above might have changed their minds.】<br>
The orange mask, who had been thinking so, shook his head.<br>
【There's no way there's an end-level fragment of Fear.】<br>
【If there were still such fragments, the 'Twelve Thrones' of <Olympus> and the 'Locapala' of <Veda> would have already descended, turning the city upside down.】<br>
【When is the next scenario launch?】<br>
【It's in an hour.】<br>
【The Light Sword Emperor? Or are we just going to leave him alone?】<br>
【A small [Fate] launch order will soon be issued from the 'Giant Nebulae'.】<br>
[Fate].<br>
At that statement, the recorders in the room whispered.<br>
【You're using [Fate] to deal with just one incarnation?】<br>
【It's not just one incarnation. We've deployed ascenders, but we still haven't caught him. It's an incarnation with combat power greater than that of a narrative-grade heavy machine.】<br>
The orange mask, listening to the recorders' conversation, asked.<br>
【Where was he last seen?】<br>
【Near <Tamra Heavy Industry>.】<br>
【Then the objective is clear.】<br>
The orange mask stared at the <Tamra Heavy Industry> headquarters on the screen.<br>
In the basement of that company, a monster once sealed by the recorders was imprisoned.<br>
The orange mask smiled faintly, as if thinking about something.<br>
【Since it's come to this, let's create a proper finale. A scenario of this scale will surely interest even the 'high-ranking recorders'.】<br>
The objective of every 'Recorder of Fear' is clear. It was about completing the 'ultimate sentence' to be left on the 'Final Wall'.<br>
However, not all recorders were able to achieve this ultimate sentence. Only the chosen recorders left behind great records.<br>
Therefore, most recorders wanted to write 'commentaries' to accompany such a 'great sentence'.<br>
【Listen carefully, everyone. If we successfully complete this scenario, we might even be able to claim the 'commentary' position from the high-ranking recorders who monopolize the interpretation of the wall.】<br>
【Re, really?】<br>
【Yes.】<br>
The recorders' eyes were filled with fear and excitement. It was understandable, for they were the 'high-ranking recorders' of the <Star Stream>, beings they couldn't even dare to listen to, let alone look at—even their true names.<br>
But what if they could help these high-ranking recorders complete the 'ultimate sentence'...?<br>
Just then, one of the recorders, who had been scanning the screen, ran over.<br>
【Urgent news. Two recorders just stopped writing.】<br>
Stopped writing. The weight of these words made all the recorders' expressions harden for a moment. For the recorders, the 'stop writing' was a punishment akin to eternal destruction, in terms of constellations.<br>
The orange mask asked.<br>
【What kind of guys are they?】<br>
【Newbies. They're called 'Those who write about youth' and 'Those who don't like twists and turns'.】<br>
The orange mask's eyes narrowed.<br>
No matter what they did in this city, it was unlikely to cause an incident worthy of 'stopping writing'.<br>
【If there was a possibility, it would be if the embodiment of the 'Record Contract' died.】<br>
The orange mask spoke in a grave voice.<br>
【Perhaps it was the work of that bastard, the Light Sword Emperor.】<br>
【The Light Sword Emperor.】<br>
The tense recorders exchanged glances.<br>
【Dispatch ascenders to the nearby area. If the Light Sword Emperor is discovered—】<br>
The order was finally given.<br>
【Prepare to declare [Fate] immediately.】<br>
*<br>
The 'Recorder of Fear' trembled before my eyes.<br>
【Uh, how? How could this be happening?】<br>
To put it simply, it was like this.<br>
He moved to this 'Recording Center' as soon as it was two o'clock, and I followed him.<br>
He was jubilant, thinking he'd escaped safely, but then he turned to me and looked as if he were about to faint.<br>
Hurriedly, he collected his expression and began to speak.<br>
【W-Wouldn't you be the same 'Recorder'? But how could the contract holder and the recorder be the same person...?】<br>
I stared at the 'Unchanging One'.<br>
I expected him to have some impressive appearance since he was called a 'Recorder of Fear', but he was just a young man wearing glasses. Compared to 'Asmodeus' and 'Bichonhori' I'd met before, he felt like a mere idiot. My silence must have been what the guy was thinking, as he fell to the ground and cried out.<br>
【Please save me! I will never touch your contract again! I will not come near you! I will not add a single conjunction or adverb to your presence!】<br>
I watched him for a moment before opening my mouth.<br>
But no sound came out. Is it impossible to speak audibly in this space? In that case…<br>
【Do you speak like this?】<br>
At that moment, the 'Unchanging One' heard my voice and opened his eyes wide.
